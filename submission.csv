a835b697-2beb-1ba8-e053-2995a90a470c,The following serious adverse reactions are described in more detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the labeling: Serious Skin Rashes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Blood Dyscrasias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Aseptic Meningitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Withdrawal Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Epilepsy Most Common Adverse Reactions in All Clinical Trials: Adjunctive Therapy in Adults with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (>5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with lamotrigine during adjunctive therapy in adults and not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients were: dizziness ataxia somnolence headache diplopia blurred vision nausea vomiting and rash. Dizziness diplopia ataxia blurred vision nausea and vomiting were dose related. Dizziness diplopia ataxia and blurred vision occurred more commonly in patients receiving carbamazepine with lamotrigine than in patients receiving other AEDs with lamotrigine. Clinical data suggest a higher incidence of rash including serious rash in patients receiving concomitant valproate than in patients not receiving valproate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Approximately 11% of the 3378 adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (3.0%) dizziness (2.8%) and headache (2.5%). In a dose-response trial in adults the rate of discontinuation of lamotrigine for dizziness ataxia diplopia blurred vision nausea and vomiting was dose related. Monotherapy in Adults with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (>5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine during the monotherapy phase of the controlled trial in adults not seen at an equivalent rate in the control group were vomiting coordination abnormality dyspepsia nausea dizziness rhinitis anxiety insomnia infection pain weight decrease chest pain and dysmenorrhea. The most commonly observed (>5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions associated with the use of lamotrigine during the conversion to monotherapy (add-on) period not seen at an equivalent frequency among low-dose valproate-treated patients were dizziness headache nausea asthenia coordination abnormality vomiting rash somnolence diplopia ataxia accidental injury tremor blurred vision insomnia nystagmus diarrhea lymphadenopathy pruritus and sinusitis. Approximately 10% of the 420 adult patients who received lamotrigine as monotherapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (4.5%) headache (3.1%) and asthenia (2.4%). Adjunctive Therapy in Pediatric Patients with Epilepsy: The most commonly observed (>5% for lamotrigine and more common on drug than placebo) adverse reactions seen in association with the use of lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment in pediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years and not seen at an equivalent rate in the control group were infection vomiting rash fever somnolence accidental injury dizziness diarrhea abdominal pain nausea ataxia tremor asthenia bronchitis flu syndrome and diplopia. In 339 patients aged 2 to 16 years with partial-onset seizures or generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 4.2% of patients on lamotrigine and 2.9% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reaction that led to discontinuation of lamotrigine was rash. Approximately 11.5% of the 1081 pediatric patients aged 2 to 16 years who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation were rash (4.4%) reaction aggravated (1.7%) and ataxia (0.6%). Controlled Adjunctive Clinical Trials in Adults with Epilepsy: Table 8 lists adverse reactions that occurred in adult patients with epilepsy treated with lamotrigine in placebo-controlled trials. In these trials either lamotrigine or placebo was added to the patient's current AED therapy. Table 8. Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Adjunctive Trials in Adult Patients with Epilepsy ab a Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with lamotrigine and at a greater incidence than placebo. b Patients in these adjunctive trials were receiving 1 to 3 of the concomitant antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine phenytoin phenobarbital or primidone in addition to lamotrigine or placebo. Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial or at discontinuation> thus patients may be included in more than 1 category.

Because the largest non-Caucasian racial subgroup was only 6% of patients exposed to lamotrigine in placebo-controlled trials there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reaction reports by race. Generally females receiving either lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy or placebo were more likely to report adverse reactions than males. The only adverse reaction for which the reports on lamotrigine were >>10% more frequent in females than males (without a corresponding difference by gender on placebo) was dizziness (difference = 16.5%). There was little difference between females and males in the rates of discontinuation of lamotrigine for individual adverse reactions. Controlled Monotherapy Trial in Adults with Partial-Onset Seizures: Table 10 lists adverse reactions that occurred in patients with epilepsy treated with monotherapy with lamotrigine in a double-blind trial following discontinuation of either concomitant carbamazepine or phenytoin not seen at an equivalent frequency in the control group. Table 10. Adverse Reactions in a Controlled Monotherapy Trial in Adult Patients with Partial-Onset Seizuresab a Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with lamotrigine and at a greater incidence than valproate-treated patients. b Patients in this trial were converted to lamotrigine or valproate monotherapy from adjunctive therapy with carbamazepine or phenytoin.

Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients and were numerically more frequent during the dose-escalation phase of lamotrigine in these trials (when patients may have been receiving concomitant medications) compared with the monotherapy phase were: headache (25%) rash (11%) dizziness (10%) diarrhea (8%) dream abnormality (6%) and pruritus (6%). During the monotherapy phase of the double-blind placebo-controlled trials of 18 months' duration 13% of 227 patients who received lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day) 16% of 190 patients who received placebo and 23% of 166 patients who received lithium discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that most commonly led to discontinuation of lamotrigine were rash (3%) and mania/hypomania/mixed mood adverse reactions (2%). Approximately 16% of 2401 patients who received lamotrigine (50 to 500 mg/day) for bipolar disorder in premarketing trials discontinued therapy because of an adverse reaction most commonly due to rash (5%) and mania/hypomania/mixed mood adverse reactions (2%). The overall adverse reaction profile for lamotrigine was similar between females and males between elderly and nonelderly patients and among racial groups. Table 12.

Patients may have reported multiple adverse reactions during the trial> thus patients may be included in more than 1 category. cIn the overall bipolar and other mood disorders clinical trials the rate of serious rash was 0.08% (1 of 1233) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as initial monotherapy and 0.13% (2 of 1538) of adult patients who received lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Other reactions that occurred in 5% or more patients but equally or more frequently in the placebo group included: dizziness mania headache infection influenza pain accidental injury diarrhea and dyspepsia. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of less than 5% and greater than 1% of patients receiving lamotrigine and numerically more frequent than placebo were: General: Fever neck pain. Cardiovascular: Migraine. Digestive: Flatulence. Metabolic and Nutritional: Weight gain edema. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia myalgia. Nervous System: Amnesia depression agitation emotional lability dyspraxia abnormal thoughts dream abnormality hypoesthesia. Respiratory: Sinusitis. Urogenital: Urinary frequency. Adverse Reactions following Abrupt Discontinuation: In the 2 controlled clinical trials there was no increase in the incidence severity or type of adverse reactions in patients with bipolar disorder after abruptly terminating therapy with lamotrigine. In the clinical development program in adults with bipolar disorder 2 patients experienced seizures shortly after abrupt withdrawal of lamotrigine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]. Mania/Hypomania/Mixed Episodes: During the double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials in bipolar I disorder in which adults were converted to monotherapy with lamotrigine (100 to 400 mg/day) from other psychotropic medications and followed for up to 18 months the rates of manic or hypomanic or mixed mood episodes reported as adverse reactions were 5% for patients treated with lamotrigine (n = 227) 4% for patients treated with lithium (n = 166) and 7% for patients treated with placebo (n = 190). In all bipolar controlled trials combined adverse reactions of mania (including hypomania and mixed mood episodes) were reported in 5% of patients treated with lamotrigine (n = 956) 3% of patients treated with lithium (n = 280) and 4% of patients treated with placebo (n = 803). 6.2 Other Adverse Reactions Observed in All Clinical Trials Lamotrigine has been administered to 6694 individuals for whom complete adverse reaction data was captured during all clinical trials only some of which were placebo controlled. During these trials all adverse reactions were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse reactions similar types of adverse reactions were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 6694 individuals exposed to lamotrigine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving lamotrigine. All reported adverse reactions are included except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in the labeling those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Adverse reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare adverse reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

1de33ba1-e843-401a-8b7a-39fbeaadeaf8,ADVERSE REACTIONS Data upon which the following estimates of incidence of adverse reactions are made are derived from experiences reported in the literature unpublished clinical trials and voluntary reports since marketing of allopurinol began. Past experience suggested that the most frequent event following the initiation of allopurinol treatment was an increase in acute attacks of gout (average 6% in early studies). An analysis of current usage suggests that the incidence of acute gouty attacks has diminished to less than 1%. The explanation for this decrease has not been determined but may be due in part to initiating therapy more gradually (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The most frequent adverse reaction to allopurinol is skin rash. Skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal. Therefore treatment with allopurinol should be discontinued immediately if a rash develops (see WARNINGS ). Some patients with the most severe reaction also had fever chills arthralgias cholestatic jaundice eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis or leukopenia. Among 55 patients with gout treated with allopurinol for 3 to 34 months (average greater than 1 year) and followed prospectively Rundles observed that 3% of patients developed a type of drug reaction which was predominantly a pruritic maculopapular skin eruption sometimes scaly or exfoliative. However with current usage skin reactions have been observed less frequently than 1%. The explanation for this decrease is not obvious. The incidence of skin rash may be increased in the presence of renal insufficiency. The frequency of skin rash among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol has been reported to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS ). Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome or drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) has been reported in association with allopurinol use. The syndrome includes many of the severe reactions described above and is potentially life-threatening and fatal. The syndrome is often characterized by fever severe and profuse skin rash elevated leukocyte counts and in particular elevated eosinophil counts lymphadenopathy and multi-organ pathologies. Systemic symptoms often included but were not limited to the hepatic and renal systems. Symptoms involving the cardiac gastrointestinal lymphatic pulmonary and ophthalmic systems were also reported as occurring as part of the syndrome. It has been reported that symptoms may develop in approximately 1 week from initiating allopurinol therapy but longer latency periods have also been reported.,"     voluntary reports, marketing allopurinol, frequent, event, initiation, allopurinol, treatment, increase, acute attacks gout, analysis, usage,  acute gouty attacks, decrease, therapy, dosage, administration, frequent, reaction, allopurinol, skin rash, skin, fatal, treatment, allopurinol, discontinued, rash, develops, severe, reaction, fever chills arthralgias, cholestatic jaundice, leukocytosis, leukopenia, gout,  allopurinol, months,  rundles, type drug reaction, pruritic maculopapular, skin eruption, scaly exfoliative, usage, skin, decrease,  skin rash, renal insufficiency, frequency, skin rash, ampicillin, amoxicillin, allopurinol, drug rash, eosinophilia, systemic, symptoms, dress syndrome, drug hypersensitivity syndrome, association, allopurinol, syndrome, severe, life-threatening, fatal, syndrome, fever, severe, profuse, skin rash, elevated, leukocyte, elevated, eosinophil, multi-organ pathologies, systemic symptoms, hepatic renal systems, symptoms, cardiac gastrointestinal lymphatic pulmonary ophthalmic systems, part syndrome, symptoms, week, allopurinol therapy, longer, latency"
5c49fb37-1f09-4965-b213-5580d3a30a11,ADVERSE REACTIONS Enalapril maleate has been evaluated for safety in more than 10000 patients including over 1000 patients treated for one year or more. Enalapril maleate has been found to be generally well tolerated in controlled clinical trials involving 2987 patients. For the most part adverse experiences were mild and transient in nature. In clinical trials discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse experiences was required in 3.3 percent of patients with hypertension and in 5.7 percent of patients with heart failure. The frequency of adverse experiences was not related to total daily dosage within the usual dosage ranges. In patients with hypertension the overall percentage of patients treated with enalapril maleate reporting adverse experiences was comparable to placebo. Hypertension Adverse experiences occurring in greater than one percent of patients with hypertension treated with enalapril maleate in controlled clinical trials are shown below. In patients treated with enalapril maleate the maximum duration of therapy was three years> in placebo-treated patients the maximum duration of therapy was 12 weeks. Heart Failure Adverse experiences occurring in greater than one percent of patients with heart failure treated with enalapril maleate are shown below. The incidences represent the experiences from both controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials (maximum duration of therapy was approximately one year). In the placebo- treated patients the incidences reported are from the controlled trials (maximum duration of therapy is 12 weeks). The percentage of patients with severe heart failure (NYHA Class IV) was 29 percent and 43 percent for patients treated with enalapril maleate and placebo respectively. Other serious clinical adverse experiences occurring since the drug was marketed or adverse experiences occurring in 0.5 to 1.0 percent of patients with hypertension or heart failure in clinical trials are listed below and within each category are in order of decreasing severity. Body As A Whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions ). Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest> myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high risk patients (see WARNINGS Hypotension )> pulmonary embolism and infarction> pulmonary edema> rhythm disturbances including atrial tachycardia and bradycardia> atrial fibrillation> palpitation Raynaud's phenomenon. Digestive: Ileus pancreatitis hepatic failure hepatitis (hepatocellular [proven on rechallenge] or cholestatic jaundice) (see WARNINGS Hepatic Failure ) melena anorexia dyspepsia constipation glossitis stomatitis dry mouth. Hematologic: Rare cases of neutropenia thrombocytopenia and bone marrow depression. Musculoskeletal: Muscle cramps. Nervous/Psychiatric: Depression confusion ataxia somnolence insomnia nervousness peripheral neuropathy (e.g. paresthesia dysesthesia) dream abnormality. Respiratory: Bronchospasm rhinorrhea sore throat and hoarseness asthma upper respiratory infection pulmonary infiltrates eosinophilic pneumonitis.

Miscellaneous: A symptom complex has been reported which may include some or all of the following: a positive ANA an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate arthralgia/arthritis myalgia/myositis fever serositis vasculitis leukocytosis eosinophilia photosensitivity rash and other dermatologic manifestations. Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving enalapril maleate with an incidence higher in black than in non-black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face extremities lips tongue glottis and/or larynx occurs treatment with enalapril maleate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately (see WARNINGS Head and Neck Angioedema ). Hypotension: In the hypertensive patients hypotension occurred in 0.9 percent and syncope occurred in 0.5 percent of patients following the initial dose or during extended therapy. Hypotension or syncope was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1 percent of hypertensive patients. In heart failure patients hypotension occurred in 6.7 percent and syncope occurred in 2.2 percent of patients. Hypotension or syncope was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 1.9 percent of patients with heart failure (see WARNINGS Hypotension ). Cough: See PRECAUTIONS Cough . Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients appears to be similar to that seen in adult patients. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS Hyperkalemia ) hyponatremia. Creatinine Blood Urea Nitrogen In controlled clinical trials minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine reversible upon discontinuation of therapy were observed in about 0.2 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with enalapril maleate alone. Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics or in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS Impaired Renal Function ). In patients with heart failure who were also receiving diuretics with or without digitalis increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine usually reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril maleate and/or other concomitant diuretic therapy were observed in about 11 percent of patients. Increases in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were a cause for discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients. Hematology Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.3 g percent and 1.0 vol percent respectively) occur frequently in either hypertension or congestive heart failure patients treated with enalapril maleate but are rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexists. In clinical trials less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Hemolytic anemia including cases of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency has been reported> a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded.

a58c56b2-e05c-6697-e053-2a95a90ad466,6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypertension Losartan potassium has been evaluated for safety in more than 3300 adult patients treated for essential hypertension and 4058 patients/subjects overall. Over 1200 patients were treated for over 6 months and more than 800 for over one year. Treatment with losartan potassium was well-tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo. In controlled clinical trials discontinuation of therapy for adverse events occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with losartan potassium and 3.7% of patients given placebo. In 4 clinical trials involving over 1000 patients on various doses (10-150 mg) of losartan potassium and over 300 patients given placebo the adverse events that occurred in >2% of patients treated with losartan potassium and more commonly than placebo were: dizziness (3% vs. 2%) upper respiratory infection (8% vs. 7%) nasal congestion (2% vs. 1%) and back pain (2% vs. 1%). The following less common adverse reactions have been reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia. Psychiatric disorders: Depression. Nervous system disorders: Somnolence headache sleep disorders paresthesia migraine. Ear and labyrinth disorders: Vertigo tinnitus. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations syncope atrial fibrillation CVA. Respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Dyspnea. Gastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal pain constipation nausea vomiting. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria pruritus rash photosensitivity. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Myalgia arthralgia. Reproductive system and breast disorders: Impotence. General disorders and administration site conditions: Edema. Cough Persistent dry cough (with an incidence of a few percent) has been associated with ACE-inhibitor use and in practice can be a cause of discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Two prospective parallel-group double-blind randomized controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who had experienced cough while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. Patients who had typical ACE-inhibitor cough when challenged with lisinopril whose cough disappeared on placebo were randomized to losartan 50 mg lisinopril 20 mg or either placebo (one study n=97) or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n=135). The double-blind treatment period lasted up to 8 weeks. The incidence of cough is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: * Demographics = (89% Caucasian 64% female) u2020 Demographics = (90% Caucasian 51% female) Study 1* HCTZ Losartan Lisinopril Cough 25% 17% 69% Study 2u2020 Placebo Losartan Lisinopril Cough 35% 29% 62% These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy in a population that all had cough associated with ACE-inhibitor therapy is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy. Cases of cough including positive re-challenges have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience. Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy In the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint (LIFE) study adverse reactions with losartan potassium were similar to those reported previously for patients with hypertension. Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) study involving 1513 patients treated with losartan potassium or placebo the overall incidences of reported adverse events were similar for the two groups. Discontinuations of losartan potassium because of side effects were similar to placebo (19% for losartan potassium 24% for placebo). The adverse events regardless of drug relationship reported with an incidence of >4% of patients treated with losartan potassium and occurring with >2% difference in the losartan group vs. placebo on a background of conventional antihypertensive therapy were asthenia/fatigue chest pain hypotension orthostatic hypotension diarrhea anemia hyperkalemia hypoglycemia back pain muscular weakness and urinary tract infection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience with losartan potassium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Digestive: Hepatitis. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Malaise. Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity: Angioedema including swelling of the larynx and glottis causing airway obstruction and/or swelling of the face lips pharynx and/or tongue has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan> some of these patients previously experienced angioedema with other drugs including ACE inhibitors. Vasculitis including Henoch-Schxf6nlein purpura has been reported. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Metabolic and Nutrition: Hyponatremia. Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis.

b88efb93-f1d1-4606-a669-6896f432a27f,ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leucopenia have been reported in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy. Leucopenia associated with silver sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil count. Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of initiation of therapy. Rebound to normal leukocyte levels follows onset within two to three days. Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver sulfadiazine therapy. The incidence of leucopenia in various reports averages about 20%. A higher incidence has been seen in patients treated concurrently with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis erythema multiforme skin discoloration burning sensation rashes and interstitial nephritis. Reduction in bacterial growth after application of topical antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial thickness burns by preventing conversion of the partial thickness to full thickness by sepsis. However reduction in bacterial colonization has caused delayed separation in some cases necessitating escharotomy in order to prevent contracture.

25aef6c1-9964-44a1-a905-c37e5c28a3c0,ADVERSE REACTIONS During its premarketing assessment multiple doses of sertraline hydrochloride were administered to over 4000 adult subjects as of February 18 2000. The conditions and duration of exposure to sertraline hydrochloride varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) clinical pharmacology studies open and double-blind studies uncontrolled and controlled studies inpatient and outpatient studies fixed-dose and titration studies and studies for multiple indications including major depressive disorder OCD panic disorder PTSD PMDD and social anxiety disorder. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow a World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented therefore represent the proportion of the over 4000 adult individuals exposed to multiple doses of sertraline hydrochloride who experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving sertraline hydrochloride. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. It is important to emphasize that events reported during therapy were not necessarily caused by it. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied. Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Trials Table 2 enumerates the most common treatment-emergent adverse events associated with the use of sertraline hydrochloride (incidence of at least 5% for sertraline hydrochloride and at least twice that for placebo within at least one of the indications) for the treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder/other* OCD panic disorder PTSD PMDD and social anxiety disorder in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Most patients in major depressive disorder/other* OCD panic disorder PTSD and social anxiety disorder studies received doses of 50 to 200 mg/day. Patients in the PMDD study with daily dosing throughout the menstrual cycle received doses of 50 to 150 mg/day and in the PMDD study with dosing during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle received doses of 50 to 100 mg/day. Table 3 enumerates treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in 2% or more of adult patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride and with incidence greater than placebo who participated in controlled clinical trials comparing sertraline hydrochloride with placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder/other* OCD panic disorder PTSD PMDD and social anxiety disorder. Table 3 provides combined data for the pool of studies that are provided separately by indication in Table 2. Associated with Discontinuation in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists the adverse events associated with discontinuation of sertraline hydrochloride treatment (incidence at least twice that for placebo and at least 1% for sertraline hydrochloride in clinical trials) in major depressive disorder/other* OCD panic disorder PTSD PMDD and social anxiety disorder. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain however in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. Table 5 below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking sertraline hydrochloride in placebo-controlled trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with sertraline treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Other Adverse Events in Pediatric Patients In over 600 pediatric patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride the overall profile of adverse events was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. However the following adverse events from controlled trials not appearing in Tables 2 and 3 were reported at an incidence of at least 2% and occurred at a rate of at least twice the placebo rate (N=281 patients treated with sertraline hydrochloride): fever hyperkinesia urinary incontinence aggressive reaction sinusitis epistaxis and purpura. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse events reported during premarketing assessment of sertraline hydrochloride in clinical trials (over 4000 adult subjects) except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling. In the tabulations that follow a World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented therefore represent the proportion of the over 4000 adult individuals exposed to multiple doses of sertraline hydrochloride who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving sertraline hydrochloride. All events are included except those already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling and those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those for which a causal relationship to sertraline hydrochloride treatment seemed remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with sertraline hydrochloride they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section.

Laboratory Tests In man asymptomatic elevations in serum transaminases (SGOT [or AST] and SGPT [or ALT]) have been reported infrequently (approximately 0.8%) in association with sertraline hydrochloride administration. These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 1 to 9 weeks of drug treatment and promptly diminished upon drug discontinuation. Sertraline hydrochloride therapy was associated with small mean increases in total cholesterol (approximately 3%) and triglycerides (approximately 5%) and a small mean decrease in serum uric acid (approximately 7%) of no apparent clinical importance. The safety profile observed with sertraline hydrochloride treatment in patients with major depressive disorder OCD panic disorder PTSD PMDD and social anxiety disorder is similar. Other Events Observed During the Post marketing Evaluation of Sertraline Hydrochloride Reports of adverse events temporally associated with sertraline hydrochloride that have been received since market introduction that are not listed above and that may have no causal relationship with the drug include the following: acute renal failure anaphylactoid reaction angioedema blindness optic

4b9517d2-d26b-439c-b19e-b7932c403247,ADVERSE REACTIONS The clinical program for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) consisted of 6 studies: 2 controlled clinical studies conducted in children with ADHD aged 6 to 12 years and 4 clinical pharmacology studies conducted in healthy adult volunteers. These studies included a total of 256 subjects> 195 children with ADHD and 61 healthy adult volunteers. The subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) in doses of 10 to 40 mg per day. Safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) was assessed by evaluating frequency and nature of adverse events routine laboratory tests vital signs and body weight. Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and listings that follow MedDRA terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Events in a Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial with Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules (LA) Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events A placebo-controlled double-blind parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) in children with ADHD aged 6 to 12 years. All subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) for up to 4 weeks and had their dose optimally adjusted prior to entering the double-blind phase of the trial. In the 2-week double-blind treatment phase of this study patients received either placebo or methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) at their individually-titrated dose (range 10 mg to 40 mg). The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied. Adverse events with an incidence >>5% during the initial 4-week single-blind methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) titration period of this study were headache insomnia upper abdominal pain appetite decreased and anorexia. Treatment-emergent adverse events with an incidence >>2% among methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA)-treated subjects during the 2-week double-blind phase of the clinical study were as follows: Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment In the 2-week double-blind treatment phase of a placebo-controlled parallel-group study in children with ADHD only 1 methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA)-treated subject (1/65 1.5%) discontinued due to an adverse event (depression). In the single-blind titration period of this study subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) for up to 4 weeks. During this period a total of 6 subjects (6/161 3.7%) discontinued due to adverse events. The adverse events leading to discontinuation were anger (in 2 patients) hypomania anxiety depressed mood fatigue migraine and lethargy. Adverse Events with Other Methylphenidate HCl Dosage Forms Nervousness and insomnia are the most common adverse reactions reported with other methylphenidate products. In children loss of appetite abdominal pain weight loss during prolonged therapy insomnia and tachycardia may occur more frequently> however any of the other adverse reactions listed below may also occur. Other reactions include: Cardiac: angina arrhythmia palpitations pulse increased or decreased tachycardia Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain nausea Immune: hypersensitivity reactions including skin rash urticaria fever arthralgia exfoliative dermatitis erythema multiforme with histopathological findings of necrotizing vasculitis and thrombocytopenic purpura. Metabolism/Nutrition: anorexia weight loss during prolonged therapy Nervous System: dizziness drowsiness dyskinesia headache rare reports of Tourette's syndrome toxic psychosis Vascular: blood pressure increased or decreased> cerebrovascular vasculitis> cerebral occlusions> cerebral hemorrhages and cerebrovascular accidents Although a definite causal relationship has not been established the following have been reported in patients taking methylphenidate: Blood/Lymphatic: leukopenia and/or anemia Hepatobiliary: abnormal liver function ranging from transaminase elevation to hepatic injury Musculoskeletal: rhabdomyolysis Psychiatric: transient depressed mood aggressive behavior libido changes Skin/Subcutaneous: scalp hair loss Very rare reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been received and in most of these patients were concurrently receiving therapies associated with NMS. In a single report a 10-year-old boy who had been taking methylphenidate for approximately 18 months experienced an NMS-like event within 45 minutes of ingesting his first dose of venlafaxine.

ac385fd9-fb8c-461f-959c-322c38f4515e,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is constipation. When used as a cholesterol-lowering agent predisposing factors for most complaints of constipation are high dose and increased age (more than 60 years old). Most instances of constipation are mild transient and controlled with conventional therapy. Some patients require a temporary decrease in dosage or discontinuation of therapy. Less Frequent Adverse Reactions- Abdominal discomfort and/or pain flatulence nausea vomiting diarrhea eructation anorexia steatorrhea bleeding tendencies due to hypoprothrombinemia (Vitamin K deficiency) as well as Vitamin A (one case of night blindness reported) and D deficiencies hyperchloremic acidosis in children osteoporosis rash and irritation of the skin tongue and perianal area. Rare reports of intestinal obstruction including two deaths have been reported in pediatric patients. Occasional calcified material has been observed in the biliary tree including calcification of the gallbladder in patients to whom cholestyramine resin has been given. However this may be a manifestation of the liver disease and not drug related. One patient experienced biliary colic on each of three occasions on which he took a cholestyramine for oral suspension product. One patient diagnosed as acute abdominal symptom complex was found to have a ""pasty mass"" in the transverse colon on x-ray.

859788f7-f0cc-4709-b6e2-fe58800a51b1,ADVERSE REACTIONS Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Approximately 16 % of the 453 patients who received mirtazapine tablets in US 6-week controlled clinical trials discontinued treatment due to an adverse experience compared to 7 % of the 361 placebo-treated patients in those studies. The most common events (> 1%) associated with discontinuation and considered to be drug related (i.e. those events associated with dropout at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are included in Table 2: Table 2: Common Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in 6-Week US Mirtazapine Trials Commonly Observed Adverse Events in US Controlled Clinical Trials The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of mirtazapine tablets (incidence of 5% or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients (mirtazapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) are listed in Table 3: Table 3: Common Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events Associated with the Use of Mirtazapine in 6-Week US Trials Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Mirtazapine-Treated Patients Table 4 enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more and were more frequent than in the placebo group among mirtazapine tablets-treated patients who participated in short-term US placebo-controlled trials in which patients were dosed in a range of 5 to 60 mg/day. This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least 1 episode of an event at some time during their treatment. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied. Table 4: Incidence of Adverse Clinical Experiences 1 (>1%) In Short-Term U.S. Controlled Studies ECG Changes The electrocardiograms for 338 patients who received mirtazapine tablets and 261 patients who received placebo in 6-week placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Prolongation in QTc > 500 msec was not observed among mirtazapine-treated patients> mean change in QTc was +1.6 msec for mirtazapine and -3.1 msec for placebo. Mirtazapine was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 3.4 bpm compared to 0.8 bpm for placebo. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. Other Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Mirtazapine During its premarketing assessment multiple doses of mirtazapine tablets were administered to 2796 patients in clinical studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to mirtazapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies uncontrolled and controlled studies inpatient and outpatient studies fixed-dose and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented therefore represent the proportion of the 2796 patients exposed to multiple doses of mirtazapine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving mirtazapine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 those adverse experiences subsumed under COSTART terms that are either overly general or excessively specific so as to be uninformative and those events for which a drug cause was very remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with mirtazapine they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Only those events not already listed in Table 4 appear in this listing. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections.

75a4cfe2-a35b-497a-8705-74f6dc9ea4da,ADVERSE REACTIONS Body as a Whole The reported incidence of allergic reactions to penicillin ranges from 0.7 to 10 percent (see WARNINGS ). Sensitization is usually the result of treatment but some individuals have had immediate reactions to penicillin when first treated. In such cases it is thought that the patients may have had prior exposure to the drug via trace amounts present in milk and vaccines. Two types of allergic reactions to penicillin are noted clinically immediate and delayed. Immediate reactions usually occur within 20 minutes of administration and range in severity from urticaria and pruritus to angioneurotic edema laryngospasm bronchospasm hypotension vascular collapse and death. Such immediate anaphylactic reactions are very rare (see WARNINGS ) and usually occur after parenteral therapy but have occurred in patients receiving oral therapy. Another type of immediate reaction an accelerated reaction may occur between 20 minutes and 48 hours after administration and may include urticaria pruritus and fever. Although laryngeal edema laryngospasm and hypotension occasionally occur fatality is uncommon. Delayed allergic reactions to penicillin therapy usually occur after 48 hours and sometimes as late as 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy. Manifestations of this type of reaction include serum sickness-like symptoms (i.e. fever malaise urticaria myalgia arthralgia abdominal pain) and various skin rashes. Nausea vomiting diarrhea stomatitis black or hairy tongue and other symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation may occur especially during oral penicillin therapy. Nervous System Reactions Neurotoxic reactions similar to those observed with penicillin G may occur with large intravenous doses of oxacillin especially in patients with renal insufficiency. Urogenital Reactions Renal tubular damage and interstitial nephritis have been associated infrequently with the administration of oxacillin. Manifestations of this reaction may include rash fever eosinophilia hematuria proteinuria and renal insufficiency. Nephropathy induced by penicillins does not appear to be dose-related and is generally reversible upon prompt discontinuation of therapy. Gastrointestinal Reactions Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with the use of oxacillin. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS ). Metabolic Reactions Agranulocytosis neutropenia and bone marrow depression have been associated with the use of oxacillin.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder: The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for paroxetine tablets at least twice that for placebo derived from Table 4) were: Asthenia infection constipation decreased appetite dry mouth nausea libido decreased somnolence tremor sweating and abnormal ejaculation. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for paroxetine tablets at least twice that for placebo derived from Table 4) were: Asthenia sweating nausea dry mouth diarrhea decreased appetite somnolence libido decreased abnormal ejaculation female genital disorders and impotence. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials: The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables following cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the populations studied. Major Depressive Disorder: Table 2 enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more among paroxetine-treated patients who participated in short-term (6-week) placebo-controlled trials in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg to 50 mg/day. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Panic Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder: Table 3 enumerates adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more among OCD patients on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 12-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg to 60 mg/day or among patients with panic disorder on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 10- to 12-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 10 mg to 60 mg/day or among patients with social anxiety disorder on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 12-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg to 50 mg/day. Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Table 4 enumerates adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more among GAD patients on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 8-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 10 mg/day to 50 mg/day or among PTSD patients on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 12-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg/day to 50 mg/day. Dose Dependency of Adverse Events: A comparison of adverse event rates in a fixed-dose study comparing 10 20 30 and 40 mg/day of paroxetine tablets with placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder revealed a clear dose dependency for some of the more common adverse events associated with use of paroxetine tablets as shown in Table 5: In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 40 and 60 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of OCD there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned. No new adverse events were observed in the group treated with 60 mg of paroxetine tablets compared to any of the other treatment groups. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 10 20 and 40 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of panic disorder there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned except for asthenia dry mouth anxiety libido decreased tremor and abnormal ejaculation. In flexible-dose studies no new adverse events were observed in patients receiving 60 mg of paroxetine tablets compared to any of the other treatment groups. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 40 and 60 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of social anxiety disorder for most of the adverse events there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 and 40 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder for most of the adverse events there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned except for the following adverse events: Asthenia constipation and abnormal ejaculation. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 and 40 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder for most of the adverse events there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned except for impotence and abnormal ejaculation. Adaptation to Certain Adverse Events: Over a 4- to 6-week period there was evidence of adaptation to some adverse events with continued therapy (e.g. nausea and dizziness) but less to other effects (e.g. dry mouth somnolence and asthenia). Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs: Although changes in sexual desire sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain however in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. In placebo-controlled clinical trials involving more than 3200 patients the ranges for the reported incidence of sexual side effects in males and females with major depressive disorder OCD panic disorder social anxiety disorder GAD and PTSD are displayed in Table 6. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with paroxetine treatment. Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome patients recovered without sequelae. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Weight and Vital Sign Changes: Significant weight loss may be an undesirable result of treatment with paroxetine tablets for some patients but on average patients in controlled trials had minimal (about 1 pound) weight loss versus smaller changes on placebo and active control. No significant changes in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure pulse and temperature) were observed in patients treated with paroxetine tablets in controlled clinical trials. ECG Changes: In an analysis of ECGs obtained in 682 patients treated with paroxetine tablets and 415 patients treated with placebo in controlled clinical trials no clinically significant changes were seen in the ECGs of either group. Liver Function Tests: In placebo-controlled clinical trials patients treated with paroxetine tablets exhibited abnormal values on liver function tests at no greater rate than that seen in placebo-treated patients. In particular the paroxetine tablets-versus-placebo comparisons for alkaline phosphatase SGOT SGPT and bilirubin revealed no differences in the percentage of patients with marked abnormalities. Hallucinations: In pooled clinical trials of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride hallucinations were observed in 22 of 9089 patients receiving drug and 4 of 3187 patients receiving placebo. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Paroxetine Tablets: During its premarketing assessment in major depressive disorder multiple doses of paroxetine tablets were administered to 6145 patients in phase 2 and 3 studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to paroxetine tablets varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies uncontrolled and controlled studies inpatient and outpatient studies and fixed-dose and titration studies. During premarketing clinical trials in OCD panic disorder social anxiety disorder generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder 542 469 522 735 and 676 patients respectively received multiple doses of paroxetine tablets. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented therefore represent the proportion of the 9089 patients exposed to multiple doses of paroxetine tablets who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving paroxetine tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in Tables 2 to 5 those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with paroxetine they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse events are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing)> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

8a5fb6a2-9fae-4872-8c5c-0f1ba03a57cb,ADVERSE EXPERIENCES More than 6000 patients world-wide have received nisoldipine in clinical trials for the treatment of hypertension either as the immediate release or the nisoldipine extended release formulation. Of about 1500 patients who received nisoldipine in hypertension studies about 55% were exposed for at least 2 months and about one third were exposed for over 6 months the great majority at doses equivalent to 17 mg and above. Nisoldipine is generally well-tolerated. In the U.S. clinical trials of nisoldipine in hypertension 10.9% of the 921 nisoldipine patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 2.9% of 280 placebo patients. The frequency of discontinuations due to adverse experiences was related to dose with a 5.4% and 10.9% discontinuation rate at the lowest and highest daily dose respectively. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences with nisoldipine are those related to its vasodilator properties> these are generally mild and only occasionally lead to patient withdrawal from treatment. The table below from U.S. placebo-controlled parallel dose response trials of nisoldipine using doses across the clinical dosage range in patients with hypertension lists all of the adverse events regardless of the causal relationship to nisoldipine for which the overall incidence on nisoldipine was both >>1% and greater with nisoldipine than with placebo. The common adverse events occurred at about the same rate in men as in women and at a similar rate in patients over age 65 as in those under that age except that headache was much less common in older patients. Except for peripheral edema and vasodilation which were more common in whites adverse event rates were similar in blacks and whites. The following adverse events occurred in <1% of all patients treated for hypertension in U.S. and foreign clinical trials or with unspecified incidence in other studies. Although a causal relationship of nisoldipine to these events cannot be established they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship with nisoldipine treatment.

56bd4d14-0f98-401b-965a-729233c171cc,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been reported: CNS Depression - Residual sedation or ""hangover"" drowsiness lethargy and vertigo. Emotional disturbances and phobias may be accentuated. In some persons barbiturates such as phenobarbital repeatedly produce excitement rather than depression and the patient may appear to be inebriated. Irritability and hyperactivity can occur in children. Like other nonanalgesic hypnotic drugs barbiturates such as phenobarbital when given in the presence of pain may cause restlessness excitement and even delirium. Rarely the use of barbiturates results in localized or diffuse myalgic neuralgic or arthritic pain especially in psychoneurotic patients with insomnia. The pain may appear in paroxysms is most intense in the early morning hours and is most frequently located in the region of the neck shoulder girdle and upper limbs. Symptoms may last for days after the drug is discontinued. Respiratory/Circulatory - Respiratory depression apnea circulatory collapse. Allergic - Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma urticaria angioedema and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling particularly of the eyelids cheeks or lips and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever delirium and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital. Other - Nausea and vomiting> headache osteomalacia. The following adverse reactions and their incidence were compiled from surveillance of thousands of hospitalized patients who received barbiturates. Because such patients may be less aware of the milder adverse effects of barbiturates the incidence of these reactions may be somewhat higher in fully ambulatory patients. More than 1 in 100 Patients: The most common adverse reaction estimated to occur at a rate of 1 to 3 patients per 100 is: Nervous System: Somnolence Less than 1 in 100 Patients: Adverse reactions estimated to occur at a rate of less than 1 in 100 patients are listed below grouped by organ system and by decreasing order of occurrence: Nervous System: Agitation confusion hyperkinesia ataxia CNS depression nightmares nervousness psychiatric disturbance hallucinations insomnia anxiety dizziness abnormality in thinking Respiratory System: Hypoventilation apnea Cardiovascular System: Bradycardia hypotension syncope Digestive System: Nausea vomiting constipation Other Reported Reactions: Headache injection site reactions hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema skin rashes exfoliative dermatitis) fever liver damage megaloblastic anemia following chronic phenobarbital use","cns depression, residual, sedation, emotional disturbances, phobias, persons, barbitu phenobarbital, excitement, depression, patient, inebriated, irritability hyperactivity, children, nonanalgesic, hypnotic drugs, barbitu phenobarbital, pain, restlessness, excitement, delirium, barbitu results, localized diffuse myalgic neuralgic, psychoneurotic insomnia, pain, paroxysms, intense, early morning, region neck shoulder girdle upper limbs, symptoms, days, drug discontinued, respiratory circulatory, respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, allergic, acquired, hypersensitivity, barbitu allergic, persons, asthma urticaria angioedema, conditions, hypersensitivity, category, localized swelling, eyelids cheeks lips erythematous dermatitis, rarely, exfoliative dermatitis, stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic, epidermal necrolysis, phenobarbital, fatal, skin eruption, fever, delirium, degenerative changes, liver parenchymatous organs, megaloblastic anemia, chronic, phenobarbital, nausea vomiting, headache osteomalacia,  surveillance, hospitalized, barbitu barbitu  ambulatory,  reaction, estimated, rate, nervous system, somnolence, rate, grouped, organ system, decreasing, occurrence, nervous system, agitation, confusion, hyperkinesia ataxia, cns, psychiatric disturbance, hallucinations, anxiety dizziness abnormality thinking, respiratory system, hypoventilation apnea, cardiovascular system, bradycardia, hypotension syncope, digestive system, nausea vomiting constipation, headache, injection site, hypersensitivity angioedema, skin rashes, exfoliative dermatitis fever, liver damage, megaloblastic anemia, chronic phenobarbital"
a825166c-fac2-06b1-e053-2995a90a58cf,The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hemolytic anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials 580 patients from 31 to 87 years of age received glipizide extended-release tablets in doses from 5 mg to 60 mg in both controlled and open trials. The dosages above 20 mg are not recommended dosages. In these trials approximately 180 patients were treated with glipizide extended-release tablets for at least 6 months. Table 1 summarizes the incidence of adverse reactions other than hypoglycemia that were reported in pooled double-blind placebo-controlled trials in >3% of glipizide extended-release tablets-treated patients and more commonly than in patients who received placebo. Table 1: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions Reported in >3% of Patients Treated in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials and More Commonly in Patients Treated with Glipizide Extended-Release Tablets (Excluding Hypoglycemia) Glipizide Extended-Release Tablets (%) Placebo (%) (N=278) (N=69) Adverse Effect Dizziness 6.8 5.8 Diarrhea 5.4 0.0 Nervousness 3.6 2.9 Tremor 3.6 0.0 Flatulence 3.2 1.4 Hypoglycemia: Of the 580 patients that received glipizide extended-release tablets in clinical trials 3.4% had hypoglycemia documented by a blood-glucose measurement <>60 mg/dL and/or symptoms believed to be associated with hypoglycemia and 2.6% of patients discontinued for this reason. Hypoglycemia was not reported for any placebo patients. Gastrointestinal Reactions In clinical trials the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (nausea vomiting constipation dyspepsia) occurred in <>3% of glipizide extended-release tablets-treated patients and were more common in glipizide extended-release tablets-treated patients than those receiving placebo. Dermatologic Reactions In clinical trials allergic skin reactions i.e. urticaria occurred in <>1.5% of treated patients and were more common in glipizide extended-release tablets treated patients than those receiving placebo. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of glipizide XL> if skin reactions persist the drug should be discontinued. Laboratory Tests: Mild to moderate elevations of ALT LDH alkaline phosphatase BUN and creatinine have been noted. The relationship of these abnormalities to glipizide is uncertain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of glipizide extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

a5b4092d-ab72-f5d1-e053-2995a90ac582,6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Potentially serious adverse reactions of angioedema and cholestatic jaundice were reported. Approximately 0.7% of the patients (adults and pediatric patients) from the 5-day multiple-dose clinical trials discontinued azithromycin therapy because of treatment-related adverse reactions. In adults given 500 mg/day for 3 days the discontinuation rate due to treatment-related adverse reactions was 0.6%. In clinical trials in pediatric patients given 30 mg/kg either as a single dose or over 3 days discontinuation from the trials due to treatment-related adverse reactions was approximately 1%. Most of the adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were related to the gastrointestinal tract e.g. nausea vomiting diarrhea or abdominal pain. [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] Adults Multiple-dose regimens: Overall the most common treatment-related adverse reactions in adult patients receiving multiple-dose regimens of azithromycin were related to the gastrointestinal system with diarrhea/loose stools (4 to 5%) nausea (3%) and abdominal pain (2 to 3%) being the most frequently reported. No other adverse reactions occurred in patients on the multiple-dose regimens of azithromycin with a frequency greater than 1%. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of 1% or less included the following: Cardiovascular: Palpitations chest pain. Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia flatulence vomiting melena and cholestatic jaundice. Genitourinary: Monilia vaginitis and nephritis. Nervous System: Dizziness headache vertigo and somnolence. General: Fatigue. Allergic: Rash pruritus photosensitivity and angioedema. Single 1-gram dose regimen: Overall the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving a single-dose regimen of 1 gram of azithromycin were related to the gastrointestinal system and were more frequently reported than in patients receiving the multiple-dose regimen. Adverse reactions that occurred in patients on the single 1-gram dosing regimen of azithromycin with a frequency of 1% or greater included diarrhea/loose stools (7%) nausea (5%) abdominal pain (5%) vomiting (2%) dyspepsia (1%) and vaginitis (1%). Single 2-gram dose regimen: Overall the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving a single 2-gram dose of azithromycin were related to the gastrointestinal system. Adverse reactions that occurred in patients in this study with a frequency of 1% or greater included nausea (18%) diarrhea/loose stools (14%) vomiting (7%) abdominal pain (7%) vaginitis (2%) dyspepsia (1%) and dizziness (1%). The majority of these complaints were mild in nature. Pediatric Patients Single and Multiple-dose regimens: The types of adverse reactions in pediatric patients were comparable to those seen in adults with different incidence rates for the dosage regimens recommended in pediatric patients. Acute Otitis Media: For the recommended total dosage regimen of 30 mg/kg the most frequent adverse reactions (> 1%) attributed to treatment were diarrhea abdominal pain vomiting nausea and rash. [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)] The incidence based on dosing regimen is described in the table below: Dosage Regimen Diarrhea % Abdominal Pain % Vomiting % Nausea % Rash % 1-day 4.3% 1.4% 4.9% 1.0% 1.0% 3-day 2.6% 1.7% 2.3% 0.4% 0.6% 5-day 1.8% 1.2% 1.1% 0.5% 0.4% Community-Acquired Pneumonia: For the recommended dosage regimen of 10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg on Days 2 to 5 the most frequent adverse reactions attributed to treatment were diarrhea/loose stools abdominal pain vomiting nausea and rash.

Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of 1% or less included the following: Cardiovascular: Chest pain. Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia constipation anorexia enteritis flatulence gastritis jaundice loose stools and oral moniliasis. Hematologic and Lymphatic: Anemia and leukopenia. Nervous System: Headache (otitis media dosage) hyperkinesia dizziness agitation nervousness and insomnia. General: Fever face edema fatigue fungal infection malaise and pain. Allergic: Rash and allergic reaction. Respiratory: Cough pharyngitis pleural effusion and rhinitis. Skin and Appendages: Eczema fungal dermatitis pruritus sweating urticaria and vesiculobullous rash. Special Senses: Conjunctivitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of azithromycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported with azithromycin during the postmarketing period in adult and/or pediatric patients for which a causal relationship may not be established include: Allergic: Arthralgia edema urticaria and angioedema. Cardiovascular: Arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and hypotension. There have been reports of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia constipation dyspepsia flatulence vomiting/diarrhea pseudomembranous colitis pancreatitis oral candidiasis pyloric stenosis and reports of tongue discoloration. General: Asthenia paresthesia fatigue malaise and anaphylaxis. Genitourinary: Interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure and vaginitis. Hematopoietic: Thrombocytopenia. Liver/Biliary: Abnormal liver function hepatitis cholestatic jaundice hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Nervous System: Convulsions dizziness/vertigo headache somnolence hyperactivity nervousness agitation and syncope. Psychiatric: Aggressive reaction and anxiety. Skin/Appendages: Pruritus serious skin reactions including erythema multiforme AGEP Stevens-Johnson Syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis and DRESS. Special Senses: Hearing disturbances including hearing loss deafness and/or tinnitus and reports of taste/smell perversion and/or loss. 6.3 Laboratory Abnormalities Adults: Clinically significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows: with an incidence of greater than 1%: decreased hemoglobin hematocrit lymphocytes neutrophils and blood glucose> elevated serum creatine phosphokinase potassium ALT GGT AST BUN creatinine blood glucose platelet count lymphocytes neutrophils and eosinophils> with an incidence of less than 1%: leukopenia neutropenia decreased sodium potassium platelet count elevated monocytes basophils bicarbonate serum alkaline phosphatase bilirubin LDH and phosphate. The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline. When follow-up was provided changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible. In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 5000 patients four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality. Pediatric Patients: One Three and Five-Day Regimens Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 3 days) or two 5-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 5 days) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1 to 5%. Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial.

Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets have been evaluated in open label clinical trials in patients with cancer and nonmalignant pain. Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets are associated with adverse experiences similar to those seen with other opioids. Serious adverse reactions associated with oxycodone hydrochloride tablets use included: respiratory depression respiratory arrest circulatory depression cardiac arrest hypotension and/or shock. The common adverse reactions seen on initiation of therapy with oxycodone hydrochloride tablets are dose-related and are typical opioid-related adverse reactions. The most frequent of these included nausea constipation vomiting headache pruritus insomnia dizziness asthenia and somnolence. The frequency of these reactions depended on several factors including clinical setting the patient's level of opioid tolerance and host factors specific to the individual. In all patients for whom dosing information was available (n=191) from the open-label and double-blind studies involving oxycodone hydrochloride tablets the following adverse events were recorded in oxycodone hydrochloride tablets treated patients with an incidence > 3%. In descending order of frequency they were: nausea constipation vomiting headache pruritus insomnia dizziness asthenia and somnolence. Other less frequently observed adverse reactions from opioid analgesics including oxycodone hydrochloride tablets included: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: anemia leukopenia Cardiac disorders: cardiac failure palpitation tachycardia Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal pain dry mouth diarrhea dyspepsia dysphagia glossitis nausea vomiting. General disorders and administration site conditions: chills edema edema peripheral pain pyrexia Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity Infections and infestations: bronchitis gingivitis infection pharyngitis rhinitis sepsis sinusitis urinary tract infection Injury poisoning and procedural complications: injury Metabolism and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite gout hyperglycemia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia arthritis back pain bone pain myalgia neck pain pathological fracture Nervous system disorders: hypertonia hypoesthesia migraine neuralgia tremor vasodilation Psychiatric disorders: agitation anxiety confusional state nervousness personality disorder Respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders: cough dyspnea epistaxis laryngospasm lung disorder Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: photosensitivity reaction rash hyperhidrosis urticaria Vascular disorders: thrombophlebitis hemorrhage hypotension vasodilatation 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of oxycodone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General disorders and administrative site disorders: drug withdrawal syndrome neonatal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3)] Respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pharyngeal edema Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome a potentially life-threatening condition have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7)]. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use more often following greater than one month of use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7)] . Anaphylaxis: Anaphylactic reaction has been reported with ingredients contained in ROXICODONE [see Contraindications ( 4)].

a821f647-be5f-274c-e053-2a95a90a23ce,"The adverse experiences for clonazepam are provided separately for patients with seizure disorders and with panic disorder. Seizure Disorders: The most frequently occurring side effects of clonazepam are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases these may diminish with time> behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Others listed by system including those identified during postapproval use of clonazepam are: Cardiovascular: Palpitations Dermatologic: Hair loss hirsutism skin rash ankle and facial edema Gastrointestinal: Anorexia coated tongue constipation diarrhea dry mouth encopresis gastritis increased appetite nausea sore gums Genitourinary: Dysuria enuresis nocturia urinary retention Hematopoietic: Anemia leukopenia thrombocytopenia eosinophilia Hepatic: Hepatomegaly transient elevations of serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness pains Miscellaneous: Dehydration general deterioration fever lymphadenopathy weight loss or gain Neurologic: Abnormal eye movements aphonia choreiform movements coma diplopia dysarthria dysdiadochokinesis ""glassy-eyed"" appearance headache hemiparesis hypotonia nystagmus respiratory depression slurred speech tremor vertigo Psychiatric: Confusion depression amnesia hallucinations hysteria increased libido insomnia psychosis (the behavior effects are more likely to occur in patients with a history of psychiatric disturbances). The following paradoxical reactions have been observed: excitability irritability aggressive behavior agitation nervousness hostility anxiety sleep disturbances nightmares and vivid dreams Respiratory: Chest congestion rhinorrhea shortness of breath hypersecretion in upper respiratory passages Panic Disorder: Adverse events during exposure to clonazepam were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow CIGY dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events except in certain cases in which redundant terms were collapsed into more meaningful terms as noted below. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials: Adverse Events Associated With Discontinuation of Treatment: Overall the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17% in clonazepam compared to 9% for placebo in the combined data of two 6- to 9-week trials. The most common events (>1%) associated with discontinuation and a dropout rate twice or greater for clonazepam than that of placebo included the following: Table 2. Most Common Adverse Events (>1%) Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Adverse Event Clonazepam (N=574) Placebo (N=294) Somnolence 7% 1% Depression 4% 1% Dizziness 1% <>1% Nervousness 1% 0% Ataxia 1% 0% Intellectual Ability Reduced 1% 0% Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Clonazepam-Treated Patients: Table 3 enumerates the incidence rounded to the nearest percent of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during acute therapy of panic disorder from a pool of two 6- to 9-week trials. Events reported in 1% or more of patients treated with clonazepam (doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/day) and for which the incidence was greater than that in placebo-treated patients are included. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in Table 3 cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied.

Adverse Event Clonazepam (N=574) Placebo (N=294) Somnolence 37% 10% Depression 7% 1% Coordination Abnormal 6% 0% Ataxia 5% 0% Treatment-Emergent Depressive Symptoms: In the pool of two short-term placebo-controlled trials adverse events classified under the preferred term ""depression"" were reported in 7% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients without any clear pattern of dose relatedness. In these same trials adverse events classified under the preferred term ""depression"" were reported as leading to discontinuation in 4% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. While these findings are noteworthy Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression. Other Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Clonazepam in Panic Disorder: Following is a list of modified CIGY terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with clonazepam at multiple doses during clinical trials. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling those events for which a drug cause was remote those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. It is important to emphasize that although the events occurred during treatment with clonazepam they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency. These adverse events were reported infrequently which is defined as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole: weight increase accident weight decrease wound edema fever shivering abrasions ankle edema edema foot edema periorbital injury malaise pain cellulitis inflammation localized Cardiovascular Disorders: chest pain hypotension postural Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorders: migraine paresthesia drunkenness feeling of enuresis paresis tremor burning skin falling head fullness hoarseness hyperactivity hypoesthesia tongue thick twitching Gastrointestinal System Disorders: abdominal discomfort gastrointestinal inflammation stomach upset toothache flatulence pyrosis saliva increased tooth disorder bowel movements frequent pain pelvic dyspepsia hemorrhoids Hearing and Vestibular Disorders: vertigo otitis earache motion sickness Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders: palpitation Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: thirst gout Musculoskeletal System Disorders: back pain fracture traumatic sprains and strains pain leg pain nape cramps muscle cramps leg pain ankle pain shoulder tendinitis arthralgia hypertonia lumbago pain feet pain jaw pain knee swelling knee Platelet Bleeding and Clotting Disorders: bleeding dermal Psychiatric Disorders: insomnia organic disinhibition anxiety depersonalization dreaming excessive libido loss appetite increased libido increased reactions decreased aggressive reaction apathy attention lack excitement feeling mad hunger abnormal illusion nightmares sleep disorder suicide ideation yawning Reproductive Disorders Female: breast pain menstrual irregularity Reproductive Disorders Male: ejaculation decreased Resistance Mechanism Disorders: infection mycotic infection viral infection streptococcal herpes simplex infection infectious mononucleosis moniliasis Respiratory System Disorders: sneezing excessive asthmatic attack dyspnea nosebleed pneumonia pleurisy Skin and Appendages Disorders: acne flare alopecia xeroderma dermatitis contact flushing pruritus pustular reaction skin burns skin disorder Special Senses Other Disorders: taste loss Urinary System Disorders: dysuria cystitis polyuria urinary incontinence bladder dysfunction urinary retention urinary tract bleeding urine discoloration Vascular (Extracardiac) Disorders: thrombophlebitis leg Vision Disorders: eye irritation visual disturbance diplopia eye twitching styes visual field defect xerophthalmia Controlled Substance Class: Clonazepam is a Schedule IV controlled substance. Physical and Psychological Dependence: Withdrawal symptoms similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol (e.g. convulsions psychosis hallucinations behavioral disorder tremor abdominal and muscle cramps) have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of clonazepam. The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who received excessive doses over an extended period of time. Generally milder withdrawal symptoms (e.g. dysphoria and insomnia) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months. Consequently after extended therapy abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Addiction-prone individuals (such as drug addicts or alcoholics) should be under careful surveillance when receiving clonazepam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence. Following the short-term treatment of patients with panic disorder in Studies 1 and 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: CLINICAL TRIALS) patients were gradually withdrawn during a 7-week downward-titration (discontinuance) period. Overall the discontinuance period was associated with good tolerability and a very modest clinical deterioration without evidence of a significant rebound phenomenon. However there are not sufficient data from adequate and well-controlled long-term clonazepam studies in patients with panic disorder to accurately estimate the risks of withdrawal symptoms and dependence that may be associated with such use."," clonazepam, seizure disorders, panic disorder, seizure disorders, side effects, clonazepam, cns depression,  treatment seizures, drowsiness,

It should be recognized that patients with impaired ventricular function and cardiac conduction abnormalities have usually been excluded from these studies. A total of 256 hypertensives were treated for between 4 and 8 weeks> a total of 207 patients with chronic stable angina were treated for 3 weeks with doses of diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release capsules ranging from 120 to 540 mg once daily. Two patients experienced first-degree AV block at the 540 mg dose. The following table presents the most common adverse reactions whether or not drug-related reported in placebo-controlled trials in patients receiving diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release capsules up to 360 mg and up to 540 mg with rates in placebo patients shown for comparison. In addition the following events have been reported infrequently (less than 2%) in clinical trials with other diltiazem products: Cardiovascular: Angina arrhythmia AV block (second- or third-degree) bundle branch block congestive heart failure ECG abnormalities hypotension palpitations syncope tachycardia ventricular extrasystoles. Nervous System: Abnormal dreams amnesia depression gait abnormality hallucinations insomnia nervousness paresthesia personality change somnolence tinnitus tremor.

75c2fc3e-28ac-c1b1-e053-2991aa0aee9f,ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with theophylline are generally mild when peak serum theophylline concentrations are <>20 mcg/mL and mainly consist of transient caffeine-like adverse effects such as nausea vomiting headache and insomnia. When peak serum theophylline concentrations exceed 20 mcg/mL however theophylline produces a wide range of adverse reactions including persistent vomiting cardiac arrhythmias and intractable seizures which can be lethal (see OVERDOSAGE ). Other adverse reactions that have been reported at serum theophylline concentrations <>20 mcg/mL include diarrhea irritability restlessness fine skeletal muscle tremors and transient diuresis. In patients with hypoxia secondary to COPD multifocal atrial tachycardia and flutter have been reported at serum theophylline concentrations >15 mcg/mL. There have been a few isolated reports of seizures at serum theophylline concentrations <>20 mcg/mL in patients with an underlying neurological disease or in elderly patients. The occurrence of seizures in elderly patients with serum theophylline concentrations <>20 mcg/mL may be secondary to decreased protein binding resulting in a larger proportion of the total serum theophylline concentration in the pharmacologically active unbound form. The clinical characteristics of the seizures reported in patients with serum theophylline concentrations <>20 mcg/mL have generally been milder than seizures associated with excessive serum theophylline concentrations resulting from an overdose (i.e. they have generally been transient often stopped without anticonvulsant therapy and did not result in neurological residua). Products containing aminophylline may rarely produce severe allergic reactions of the skin including exfoliative dermatitis after systemic administration in a patient who has been previously sensitized by topical application of a substance containing ethylenediamine. In such patients skin patch tests are positive for ethylenediamine a component of aminophylline and negative for theophylline. Pharmacists and other individuals who experience repeated skin exposure while physically handling aminophylline may develop a contact dermatitis due to the ethylenediamine component. Table IV. Manifestations of Theophylline Toxicity* Percentage of Patients Reported With Sign or Symptom * These data are derived from two studies in patients with serum theophylline concentrations >>30 mcg/mL. In the first study (Study #1 - Shanon Ann Intern Med 1993>119:1161-67) data were prospectively collected from 249 consecutive cases of theophylline toxicity referred to a regional poison center for consultation. In the second study (Study #2 - Sessler Am J Med 1990> 88:567-76) data were retrospectively collected from 116 cases with serum theophylline concentrations >>30 mcg/mL among 6000 blood samples obtained for measurement of serum theophylline concentrations in three emergency departments. Differences in the incidence of manifestations of theophylline toxicity between the two studies may reflect sample selection as a result of study design (e.g. in Study #1 48% of the patients had acute intoxications versus only 10% in Study #2) and different methods of reporting results. ** NR = Not reported in a comparable manner.,"theophylline, mild peak serum, theophylline, concentrations, mcg, transient, caffeine-like effects, nausea vomiting, headache insomnia, peak, theophylline, concentrations, mcg, theophylline, persistent, vomiting cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, lethal, overdosage, serum theophylline, concentrations, mcg, diarrhea, irritability restlessness, skeletal muscle, transient, diuresis, hypoxia, secondary copd, atrial tachycardia flutter, theophylline, concentrations, mcg, isolated, reports, seizures, serum theophylline, concentrations, mcg, neurological disease, elderly,  occurrence, seizures, elderly, serum theophylline, concentrations, mcg, protein binding, proportion, serum, theophylline, concentration, pharmacologically, characteristics, seizures, serum theophylline, concentrations, mcg, seizures, excessive, serum theophylline, concentrations, overdose, transient, anticonvulsant therapy, neurological residua, products, aminophylline, severe, allergic, skin, exfoliative dermatitis, systemic, patient, sensitized, topical, application, substance, ethylenediamine, skin patch tests, ethylenediamine, aminophylline, negative, theophylline, pharmacists, individuals, skin, physically handling, aminophylline, contact dermatitis, ethylenediamine component, manifestations, theophylline, toxicity, symptom,  studies, serum theophylline, concentrations, mcg, study, shanon,  consecutive,  theophylline, toxicity, regional poison center consultation, study, sessler,  retrospectively,  serum theophylline, concentrations, mcg, blood samples, measurement, theophylline, concentrations, emergency departments,  manifestations, theophylline, toxicity, studies, sample, selection, study, design, study, acute, intoxications, study, methods"

78d8fb0a-bfae-6599-e053-2991aa0a2e03,ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic Adverse experiences following the administration of lidocaine HCl are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are in general dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection or may result from a hypersensitivity idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: Central Nervous System CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness nervousness apprehension euphoria confusion dizziness drowsiness tinnitus blurred or double vision vomiting sensations of heat cold or numbness twitching tremors convulsions unconsciousness respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Drowsiness following the administration of lidocaine HCl is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular System Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia hypotension and cardiovascular collapse which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions urticaria edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in the multiple dose vials. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine but are infrequent. If allergic reactions do occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. There have been no reports of cross sensitivity between lidocaine hydrochloride and procainamide or between lidocaine hydrochloride and quinidine. Neurologic The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10440 patients who received lidocaine HCl for spinal anesthesia the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional headaches hypotension and backache> 2 percent for shivering> and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms nausea respiratory inadequacy and double vision. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic. In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block) hypotension secondary to spinal block loss of bladder and bowel control and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures.

Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported during clinical trials the following adverse experiences have been reported during clinical practice in patients treated with Ceftriaxone for Injection. Data are generally insufficient to allow an estimate of incidence or to establish causation. A small number of cases of fatal outcomes in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy have been reported in neonates receiving Ceftriaxone for Injection and calcium-containing fluids. In some of these cases the same intravenous infusion line was used for both Ceftriaxone for Injection and calcium-containing fluids and in some a precipitate was observed in the intravenous infusion line. At least one fatality has been reported in a neonate in whom Ceftriaxone for Injection and calcium-containing fluids were administered at different time points via different intravenous lines> no crystalline material was observed at autopsy in this neonate. There have been no similar reports in patients other than neonates. Gastrointestinal - pancreatitis stomatitis and glossitis. Genitourinary - oliguria ureteric obstruction post-renal acute renal failure.

ef2c1fe2-75dd-43cf-871d-540c5e36d363,ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious adverse reactions that may be associated with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets use include respiratory depression apnea respiratory arrest circulatory depression hypotension and shock [see OVERDOSAGE ]. The most frequently observed non-serious adverse reactions include lightheadedness dizziness drowsiness or sedation nausea and vomiting. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in nonambulatory patients and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down. Other adverse reactions include euphoria dysphoria constipation and pruritus. Hypersensitivity reactions may include: Skin eruptions urticarial erythematous skin reactions. Hematologic reactions may include: Thrombocytopenia neutropenia pancytopenia hemolytic anemia. Rare cases of agranulocytosis have likewise been associated with acetaminophen use. In high doses the most serious adverse effect is a dose-dependent potentially fatal hepatic necrosis. Renal tubular necrosis and hypoglycemic coma also may occur. Other adverse reactions obtained from postmarketing experiences with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are listed by organ system and in decreasing order of severity and/or frequency as follows: Body as a Whole: Anaphylactoid reaction allergic reaction malaise asthenia fatigue chest pain fever hypothermia thirst headache increased sweating accidental overdose non-accidental overdose Cardiovascular: Hypotension hypertension tachycardia orthostatic hypotension bradycardia palpitations dysrhythmias Central and Peripheral Nervous System: Stupor tremor paraesthesia hypoaesthesia lethargy seizures anxiety mental impairment agitation cerebral edema confusion dizziness Fluid and Electrolyte: Dehydration hyperkalemia metabolic acidosis respiratory alkalosis Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia taste disturbances abdominal pain abdominal distention sweating increased diarrhea dry mouth flatulence gastrointestinal disorder nausea vomiting pancreatitis intestinal obstruction ileus Hepatic: Transient elevations of hepatic enzymes increase in bilirubin hepatitis hepatic failure jaundice hepatotoxicity hepatic disorder Hearing and Vestibular: Hearing loss tinnitus Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: Acute anaphylaxis angioedema asthma bronchospasm laryngeal edema urticaria anaphylactoid reaction Metabolic and Nutritional: Hypoglycemia hyperglycemia acidosis alkalosis Musculoskeletal: Myalgia rhabdomyolysis Ocular: Miosis visual disturbances red eye Psychiatric: Drug dependence drug abuse insomnia confusion anxiety agitation depressed level of consciousness nervousness hallucination somnolence depression suicide Respiratory System: Bronchospasm dyspnea hyperpnea pulmonary edema tachypnea aspiration hypoventilation laryngeal edema Skin and Appendages: Erythema urticaria rash flushing Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis papillary necrosis proteinuria renal insufficiency and failure urinary retention Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome a potentially life-threatening condition have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.

26445bd1-12bc-4a19-8db6-1efee2043847,ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. The frequency estimates in the following table were derived from controlled studies in hypertensive patients in which adverse reactions were either volunteered by the patient (U.S. studies) or elicited e.g. by checklist (foreign studies). The reported frequency of elicited adverse effects was higher for both atenolol and placebo-treated patients than when these reactions were volunteered. Where frequency of adverse effects of atenolol and placebo is similar causal relationship to atenolol is uncertain. Acute Myocardial Infarction In a series of investigations in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly as expected for any beta blocker in atenolol-treated patients than in control patients. However these usually responded to atropine and/or to withholding further dosage of atenolol. The incidence of heart failure was not increased by atenolol. Inotropic agents were infrequently used. The reported frequency of these and other events occurring during these investigations is given in the following table. In a study of 477 patients the following adverse events were reported during either intravenous and/or oral atenolol administration: In the subsequent International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1) including over 16000 patients of whom 8037 were randomized to receive atenolol treatment the dosage of intravenous and subsequent oral atenolol was either discontinued or reduced for the following reasons: During postmarketing experience with atenolol the following have been reported in temporal relationship to the use of the drug: elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin hallucinations headache impotence Peyronie's disease postural hypotension which may be associated with syncope psoriasiform rash or exacerbation of psoriasis psychoses purpura reversible alopecia thrombocytopenia visual disturbance sick sinus syndrome and dry mouth. Atenolol like other beta blockers has been associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) lupus syndrome and Raynaud's phenomenon. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS In addition a variety of adverse effects have been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents and may be considered potential adverse effects of atenolol. Hematologic Agranulocytosis. Allergic Fever combined with aching and sore throat laryngospasm and respiratory distress. Central Nervous System Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia> an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place> short-term memory loss> emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium> and decreased performance on neuropsychometrics. Gastrointestinal Mesenteric arterial thrombosis ischemic colitis. Other Erythematous rash. Miscellaneous There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. The reported incidence is small and in most cases the symptoms have cleared when treatment was withdrawn. Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the beta blocker practolol has not been reported with atenolol.

2122b9c1-0af4-493b-82cc-63eee02f987f,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The most important adverse reactions to sodium nitroprusside are the avoidable ones of excessive hypotension and cyanide toxicity described above under WARNINGS. The adverse reactions described in this section develop less rapidly and as it happens less commonly. Methemoglobinemia: As described in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY above sodium nitroprusside infusions can cause sequestration of hemoglobin as methemoglobin. The back-conversion process is normally rapid and clinically significant methemoglobinemia (>>10%) is seen only rarely in patients receiving sodium nitroprusside injection. Even patients congenitally incapable of back-converting methemoglobin should demonstrate 10% methemoglobinemia only after they have received about 10 mg/kg of sodium nitroprusside and a patient receiving sodium nitroprusside at the maximum recommended rate (10 mcg/kg/min) would take over 16 hours to reach this total accumulated dose. Methemoglobin levels can be measured by most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who have received >>10 mg/kg of sodium nitroprusside and who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO2. Classically methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown without color change on exposure to air. When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed the treatment of choice is 1-2 mg/kg of methylene blue administered intravenously over several minutes. In patients likely to have substantial amounts of cyanide bound to methemoglobin as cyanmethemoglobin treatment of methemoglobinemia with methylene blue must be undertaken with extreme caution. Thiocyanate Toxicity: As described in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY above most of the cyanide produced during metabolism of sodium nitroprusside is eliminated in the form of thiocyanate. When cyanide elimination is accelerated by the co-infusion of thiosulfate thiocyanate production is increased. Thiocyanate is mildly neurotoxic (tinnitus miosis hyperreflexia) at serum levels of 1 mmol/L (60 mg/L). Thiocyanate toxicity is life-threatening when levels are 3 or 4 times higher (200 mg/L). The steady-state thiocyanate level after prolonged infusions of sodium nitroprusside is increased with increased infusion rate and the half-time of accumulation is 3-4 days. To keep the steady-state thiocyanate level below 1 mmol/L a prolonged infusion of sodium nitroprusside should not be more rapid than 3 mcg/kg/min> in anuric patients the corresponding limit is just 1 mcg/kg/min. When prolonged infusions are more rapid than these thiocyanate levels should be measured daily. Physiologic maneuvers (e.g. those that alter the pH of the urine) are not known to increase the elimination of thiocyanate. Thiocyanate clearance rates during dialysis on the other hand can approach the blood flow rate of the dialyzer. Thiocyanate interferes with iodine uptake by the thyroid. Abdominal pain apprehension diaphoresis ""dizziness"" headache muscle twitching nausea palpitations restlessness retching and retrosternal discomfort have been noted when the blood pressure was too rapidly reduced. These symptoms quickly disappeared when the infusion was slowed or discontinued and they did not reappear with a continued (or resumed) slower infusion. Other adverse reactions reported are: Cardiovascular: Bradycardia electrocardiographic changes tachycardia. Dermatologic: Rash. Endocrine: Hypothyroidism. Gastrointestinal: Ileus. Hematologic: Decreased platelet aggregation. Neurologic: Increased intracranial pressure. Miscellaneous: Flushing venous streaking irritation at the infusion site.","sodium nitroprusside, excessive, hypotension, toxicity, warnings,  methemoglobinemia, pharmacology, sodium nitroprusside, infusions, sequestration, hemoglobin methemoglobin, back-conversion, clinically significant, methemoglobinemia, sodium nitroprusside, injection, congenitally, back-converting methemoglobin, methemoglobinemia, sodium nitroprusside, patient, sodium nitroprusside, recommended, dose, methemoglobin levels measured laboratories, diagnosis, suspected, sodium nitroprusside, impaired, oxygen delivery, adequate, cardiac output, adequate, arterial, methemoglobinemic blood, chocolate brown, color change, exposure air, methemoglobinemia, diagnosed, treatment, methylene blue, administered, intravenously, minutes, cyanide, methemoglobin cyanmethemoglobin, treatment, methemoglobinemia, methylene blue, thiocyanate toxicity, pharmacology cyanide, metabolism sodium, thiocyanate, cyanide, accelerated, co-infusion, thiosulfate, thiocyanate production, increased, thiocyanate, neurotoxic, miosis hyperreflexia, serum levels, thiocyanate toxicity, life-threatening, levels, higher, steady-state, prolonged, infusions, sodium nitroprusside, half-time, accumulation, days, steady-state, prolonged, infusion, anuric, prolonged, infusions, thiocyanate levels, daily, physiologic maneuvers, urine, increase, elimination, thiocyanate, thiocyanate clearance,  dialysis, blood flow rate dialyzer, thiocyanate, interferes, iodine, thyroid, abdominal pain, apprehension diaphoresis dizziness headache muscle, restlessness retching, retrosternal discomfort, blood pressure, reduced, symptoms, infusion, slowed, discontinued, infusion, cardiovascular bradycardia, electrocardiographic changes, tachycardia, dermatologic rash, endocrine hypothyroidism, gastrointestinal ileus, hematologic platelet aggregation, neurologic intracranial pressure, miscellaneous flushing, venous streaking irritation, infusion site"

b0000772-2514-45a2-a75d-1bbb13c29989,ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects to alprazolam tablets if they occur are generally observed at the beginning of therapy and usually disappear upon continued medication. In the usual patient the most frequent side effects are likely to be an extension of the pharmacological activity of alprazolam eg drowsiness or light-headedness. The data cited in the two tables below are estimates of untoward clinical event incidence among patients who participated under the following clinical conditions: relatively short duration (ie four weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 4 mg/day of alprazolam (for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety) and short-term (up to ten weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 10 mg/day of alprazolam in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. These data cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors often differ from those in clinical trials. These figures cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials are conducted under a different set of conditions. Comparison of the cited figures however can provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the untoward event incidence in the population studied. Even this use must be approached cautiously as a drug may relieve a symptom in one patient but induce it in others. (For example an anxiolytic drug may relieve dry mouth [a symptom of anxiety] in some subjects but induce it [an untoward event] in others.) Additionally for anxiety disorders the cited figures can provide the prescriber with an indication as to the frequency with which physician intervention (eg increased surveillance decreased dosage or discontinuation of drug therapy) may be necessary because of the untoward clinical event. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported in Placebo-Controlled Trials of Anxiety Disorders In addition to the relatively common (ie greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated in the table above the following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines: dystonia irritability concentration difficulties anorexia transient amnesia or memory impairment loss of coordination fatigue seizures sedation slurred speech jaundice musculoskeletal weakness pruritus diplopia dysarthria changes in libido menstrual irregularities incontinence and urinary retention. In addition to the relatively common (ie greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated in the table above the following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam: seizures hallucinations depersonalization taste alterations diplopia elevated bilirubin elevated hepatic enzymes and jaundice. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients (see PRECAUTIONS General ). Adverse Events Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation in Treatment of Panic Disorder in Placebo-Controlled Trials In a larger database comprised of both controlled and uncontrolled studies in which 641 patients received alprazolam discontinuation-emergent symptoms which occurred at a rate of over 5% in patients treated with alprazolam and at a greater rate than the placebo treated group were as follows: DISCONTINUATION-EMERGENT SYMPTOM INCIDENCE From the studies cited it has not been determined whether these symptoms are clearly related to the dose and duration of therapy with alprazolam in patients with panic disorder. There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam tablets (see WARNINGS ). To discontinue treatment in patients taking alprazolam the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of alprazolam be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose> however the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. As with all benzodiazepines paradoxical reactions such as stimulation increased muscle spasticity sleep disturbances hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation rage irritability and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability hostility and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Post Introduction Reports Various adverse drug reactions have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam since market introduction. The majority of these reactions were reported through the medical event voluntary reporting system. Because of the spontaneous nature of the reporting of medical events and the lack of controls a causal relationship to the use of alprazolam cannot be readily determined. Reported events include: gastrointestinal disorder hypomania mania liver enzyme elevations hepatitis hepatic failure Stevens-Johnson syndrome angioedema peripheral edema hyperprolactinemia gynecomastia and galactorrhea (see PRECAUTI,"side effects, alprazolam, therapy, disappear, continued, medication, patient, frequent, side effects, extension, pharmacological activity, alprazolam, drowsiness light-headedness,  tables,  event,  conditions, weeks, placebo-controlled studies, dosages, day, alprazolam, management, anxiety disorders, short-term, relief symptoms, anxiety, short-term, weeks, placebo-controlled studies, dosages, day, alprazolam, panic disorder, agoraphobia,   medical practice, patient, characteristics, trials, figures, studies, drug products, placebo, group  prescriber, contributions,  non-drug factors, event,    symptom, patient, induce, anxiolytic  dry mouth, symptom, anxiety  untoward, event, anxiety disorders, prescriber,  frequency, physician, intervention, surveillance dosage, discontinuation, drug therapy, event, placebo-controlled anxiety disorders, association, benzodiazepines dystonia, irritability, concentration, difficulties, transient, amnesia, memory impairment, loss coordination, fatigue seizures, sedation, slurred speech jaundice, musculoskeletal weakness, diplopia dysarthria, changes, libido, incontinence, urinary retention, enumerated, association, alprazolam, seizures, hallucinations, depersonalization taste alterations, diplopia, elevated, bilirubin, elevated, hepatic enzymes jaundice, panic disorder, depressive disorders, reports, suicide, un discontinuation, treatment panic disorder, studies, alprazolam, discontinuation-emergent symptoms, rate,  alprazolam, rate, placebo, treated group, discontinuation-emergent symptom,  symptoms, dose, duration therapy, alprazolam, panic disorder, reports, withdrawal seizures, decrease, abrupt, discontinuation, alprazolam, discontinue, treatment, alprazolam, dosage, medical practice, daily, dosage, alprazolam, days, dosage, administration, benefit, dosage, reduction, postmarketing discontinuation study, panic disorder, recommended, taper schedule, taper schedule, groups, proportion, schedule, reduction, symptoms, withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepines, paradoxical, stimulation, hallucinations, behavioral, agitation, rage irritability, aggressive, hostile behavior, spontaneous, case reports, behavioral effects, cns drugs, psychiatric conditions, alprazolam, discontinued, isolated, published reports, small numbers, borderline, personality disorder, history, violent, aggressive behavior, alcohol substance abuse, risk events, irritability, hostility, intrusive thoughts, discontinuation, alprazolam, posttraumatic stress disorder, post, drug association, alprazolam, market, introduction, medical event, voluntary reporting system, spontaneous, medical lack controls, relationship, alprazolam, gastrointestinal disorder, hypomania mania, liver enzyme, elevations, hepatitis hepatic failure, stevens-johnson syndrome angioedema, peripheral edema, hyperprolactinemia gynecomastia galactorrhea, precauti"

94c4536f-e28e-48b1-8336-b3939917e99d,"ADVERSE REACTIONS Lotensin HCT has been evaluated for safety in over 2500 patients with hypertension> over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months and over 200 were treated for more than 1 year. The reported side effects were generally mild and transient and there was no relationship between side effects and age sex race or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 7% of U.S. patients treated with Lotensin HCT and in 4% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with Lotensin HCT in U.S. studies were cough (1.0%> see PRECAUTIONS ) ""dizziness"" (1.0%) headache (0.6%) and fatigue (0.6%). The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in more than 1% of patients treated with Lotensin HCT are shown in the table below. Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in U.S. placebo-controlled trials in 0.3% to 1.0% of patients treated with Lotensin HCT were the following: Cardiovascular: Palpitations flushing. Gastrointestinal: Vomiting diarrhea dyspepsia anorexia and constipation. Neurologic and Psychiatric: Insomnia nervousness paresthesia libido decrease dry mouth taste perversion and tinnitus. Dermatologic: Rash and sweating. Other: Urinary frequency arthralgia myalgia asthenia and pain (including chest pain and abdominal pain). Other adverse experiences reported in 0.3% or more of Lotensin HCT patients in U.S. controlled clinical trials and rarer events seen in post-marketing experience were the following> asterisked entries occurred in more than 1% of patients (in some a causal relationship to Lotensin HCT is uncertain): Cardiovascular: Syncope peripheral vascular disorder and tachycardia.

Neurologic and Psychiatric: Hypesthesia abnormal vision abnormal dreams and retinal disorder. Respiratory: Upper respiratory infection* epistaxis bronchitis rhinitis* sinusitis* and voice alteration. Other: Conjunctivitis arthritis urinary tract infection alopecia and urinary frequency*. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of either benazepril or hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16000 patients per year and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of >50000mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6700 patients per year.

Enalapril maleate has been found to be generally well tolerated in controlled clinical trials involving 2987 patients. For the most part adverse experiences were mild and transient in nature. In clinical trials discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse experiences was required in 3.3 percent of patients with hypertension and in 5.7 percent of patients with heart failure. The frequency of adverse experiences was not related to total daily dosage within the usual dosage ranges. In patients with hypertension the overall percentage of patients treated with enalapril maleate reporting adverse experiences was comparable to placebo. Hypertension Adverse experiences occurring in greater than one percent of patients with hypertension treated with enalapril maleate in controlled clinical trials are shown below. In patients treated with enalapril maleate the maximum duration of therapy was three years> in placebo-treated patients the maximum duration of therapy was 12 weeks. Heart Failure Adverse experiences occurring in greater than one percent of patients with heart failure treated with enalapril maleate are shown below. The incidences represent the experiences from both controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials (maximum duration of therapy was approximately one year). In the placebo-treated patients the incidences reported are from the controlled trials (maximum duration of therapy is 12 weeks). The percentage of patients with severe heart failure (NYHA Class IV) was 29 percent and 43 percent for patients treated with enalapril maleate and placebo respectively. Other serious clinical adverse experiences occurring since the drug was marketed or adverse experiences occurring in 0.5 to 1.0 percent of patients with hypertension or heart failure in clinical trials are listed below and within each category are in order of decreasing severity.

Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest> myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high risk patients (see WARNINGS Hypotension )> pulmonary embolism and infarction> pulmonary edema> rhythm disturbances including atrial tachycardia and bradycardia> atrial fibrillation> palpitation Raynaud's phenomenon. Digestive: Ileus pancreatitis hepatic failure hepatitis (hepatocellular [proven on rechallenge] or cholestatic jaundice) (see WARNINGS Hepatic Failure ) melena anorexia dyspepsia constipation glossitis stomatitis dry mouth. Hematologic: Rare cases of neutropenia thrombocytopenia and bone marrow depression. Musculoskeletal: Muscle cramps. Nervous/Psychiatric: Depression confusion ataxia somnolence insomnia nervousness peripheral neuropathy (e.g. paresthesia dysesthesia) dream abnormality. Respiratory: Bronchospasm rhinorrhea sore throat and hoarseness asthma upper respiratory infection pulmonary infiltrates eosinophilic pneumonitis. Skin: Exfoliative dermatitis toxic epidermal necrolysis Stevens-Johnson syndrome pemphigus herpes zoster erythema multiforme urticaria pruritus alopecia flushing diaphoresis photosensitivity. Special Senses: Blurred vision taste alteration anosmia tinnitus conjunctivitis dry eyes tearing. Urogenital: Renal failure oliguria renal dysfunction (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) flank pain gynecomastia impotence. Miscellaneous: A symptom complex has been reported which may include some or all of the following: a positive ANA an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate arthralgia/arthritis myalgia/myositis fever serositis vasculitis leukocytosis eosinophilia photosensitivity rash and other dermatologic manifestations. Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving enalapril maleate with an incidence higher in black than in non-black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face extremities lips tongue glottis and/or larynx occurs treatment with enalapril maleate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately (see WARNINGS Head and Neck Angioedema ). Hypotension: In the hypertensive patients hypotension occurred in 0.9 percent and syncope occurred in 0.5 percent of patients following the initial dose or during extended therapy. Hypotension or syncope was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1 percent of hypertensive patients. In heart failure patients hypotension occurred in 6.7 percent and syncope occurred in 2.2 percent of patients. Hypotension or syncope was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 1.9 percent of patients with heart failure (see WARNINGS Hypotension ). Cough: See PRECAUTIONS Cough . Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients appears to be similar to that seen in adult patients. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS Hyperkalemia ) hyponatremia. Creatinine Blood Urea Nitrogen In controlled clinical trials minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine reversible upon discontinuation of therapy were observed in about 0.2 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with enalapril maleate alone. Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics or in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS Impaired Renal Function ). In patients with heart failure who were also receiving diuretics with or without digitalis increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine usually reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril maleate and/or other concomitant diuretic therapy were observed in about 11 percent of patients. Increases in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were a cause for discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients. Hematology Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.3 g percent and 1.0 vol percent respectively) occur frequently in either hypertension or congestive heart failure patients treated with enalapril maleate but are rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexists. In clinical trials less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Hemolytic anemia including cases of hemolysis in patients with G-6-PD deficiency has been reported> a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded.

a43188fa-f228-4acd-8a5d-9a3462034f4b,ADVERSE REACTIONS All aminoglycosides have the potential to induce auditory vestibular and renal toxicity and neuromuscular blockade (see WARNINGS box). They occur more frequently in patients with present or past history of renal impairment of treatment with other ototoxic or nephrotoxic drugs and in patients treated for longer periods and/or with higher doses than recommended. Neurotoxicity-Ototoxicity Toxic effects on the eighth cranial nerve can result in hearing loss loss of balance or both. Amikacin primarily affects auditory function. Cochlear damage includes high frequency deafness and usually occurs before clinical hearing loss can be detected. Neurotoxicity-Neuromuscular Blockade Acute muscular paralysis and apnea can occur following treatment with aminoglycoside drugs. Nephrotoxicity Elevation of serum creatinine albuminuria presence of red and white cells casts azotemia and oliguria have been reported. Renal function changes are usually reversible when the drug is discontinued. As would be expected with any aminoglycoside reports of toxic nephropathy and acute renal failure have been received during postmarketing surveillance. Other In addition to those described above other adverse reactions which have been reported on rare occasions are skin rash drug fever headache paresthesia tremor nausea and vomiting eosinophilia arthralgia anemia hypotension and hypomagnesemia.

353b7f5b-4bbc-4ec9-84ba-d82656ea1811,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following reactions have been reported during treatment with metronidazole: Central Nervous System: The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with metronidazole have been convulsive seizures encephalopathy aseptic meningitis optic and peripheral neuropathy the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole patients should be specifically warned about these reactions and should be told to stop the drug and report immediately to their physicians if any neurologic symptoms occur. In addition patients have reported headache syncope dizziness vertigo incoordination ataxia confusion dysarthria irritability depression weakness and insomnia (see WARNINGS ). Gastrointestinal: The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract particularly nausea sometimes accompanied by headache anorexia and occasionally vomiting> diarrhea> epigastric distress> and abdominal cramping and constipation. Mouth : A sharp unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue glossitis and stomatitis have occurred> these may be associated with a sudden overgrowth of Candida which may occur during therapy. Dermatologic : Erythematous rash and pruritus. Hematopoietic : Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia)> rarely reversible thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular : Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Hypersensitivity : Urticaria erythematous rash Stevens-Johnson Syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis flushing nasal congestion dryness of the mouth (or vagina or vulva) and fever. Renal : Dysuria cystitis polyuria incontinence and a sense of pelvic pressure. Instances of darkened urine have been reported by approximately one patient in 100000. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance. Other : Proliferation of Candida in the vagina dyspareunia decrease of libido proctitis and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling ""serum sickness."" Rare cases of pancreatitis which generally abated on withdrawal of the drug have been reported. Patients with Crohn's disease are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers.

5e8b13b7-ce34-4641-a7f2-d64b7baf31c4,ADVERSE REACTIONS Data upon which the following estimates of incidence of adverse reactions are made are derived from experiences reported in the literature unpublished clinical trials and voluntary reports since marketing of allopurinol began. Past experience suggested that the most frequent event following the initiation of allopurinol treatment was an increase in acute attacks of gout (average 6% in early studies). An analysis of current usage suggests that the incidence of acute gouty attacks has diminished to less than 1%. The explanation for this decrease has not been determined but may be due in part to initiating therapy more gradually (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The most frequent adverse reaction to allopurinol is skin rash. Skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal. Therefore treatment with allopurinol should be discontinued immediately if a rash develops (see WARNINGS ). Some patients with the most severe reaction also had fever chills arthralgias cholestatic jaundice eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis or leukopenia. Among 55 patients with gout treated with allopurinol for 3 to 34 months (average greater than 1 year) and followed prospectively Rundles observed that 3% of patients developed a type of drug reaction which was predominantly a pruritic maculopapular skin eruption sometimes scaly or exfoliative. However with current usage skin reactions have been observed less frequently than 1%. The explanation for this decrease is not obvious. The incidence of skin rash may be increased in the presence of renal insufficiency. The frequency of skin rash among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol has been reported to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS ). Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome or drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) has been reported in association with allopurinol use. The syndrome includes many of the severe reactions described above and is potentially life-threatening and fatal. The syndrome is often characterized by fever severe and profuse skin rash elevated leukocyte counts and in particular elevated eosinophil counts lymphadenopathy and multi-organ pathologies. Systemic symptoms often included but were not limited to the hepatic and renal systems. Symptoms involving the cardiac gastrointestinal lymphatic pulmonary and ophthalmic systems were also reported as occurring as part of the syndrome. It has been reported that symptoms may develop in approximately 1 week from initiating allopurinol therapy but longer latency periods have also been reported.,"     voluntary reports, marketing allopurinol, frequent, event, initiation, allopurinol, treatment, increase, acute attacks gout, analysis, usage,  acute gouty attacks, decrease, therapy, dosage, administration, frequent, reaction, allopurinol, skin rash, skin, fatal, treatment, allopurinol, discontinued, rash, develops, severe, reaction, fever chills arthralgias, cholestatic jaundice, leukocytosis, leukopenia, gout,  allopurinol, months,  rundles, type drug reaction, pruritic maculopapular, skin eruption, scaly exfoliative, usage, skin, decrease,  skin rash, renal insufficiency, frequency, skin rash, ampicillin, amoxicillin, allopurinol, drug rash, eosinophilia, systemic, symptoms, dress syndrome, drug hypersensitivity syndrome, association, allopurinol, syndrome, severe, life-threatening, fatal, syndrome, fever, severe, profuse, skin rash, elevated, leukocyte, elevated, eosinophil, multi-organ pathologies, systemic symptoms, hepatic renal systems, symptoms, cardiac gastrointestinal lymphatic pulmonary ophthalmic systems, part syndrome, symptoms, week, allopurinol therapy, longer, latency"

a75b3924-ad01-2a1f-e053-2995a90a27b8,ADVERSE REACTIONS Localized Reactions: During or immediately after treatment with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin the skin at the site of treatment may develop erythema or edema or may be the locus of abnormal sensation. Rare cases of discrete purpuric or petechial reactions at the application site have been reported. Rare cases of hyperpigmentation following the use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream have been reported. The relationship to lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the underlying procedure has not been established. In clinical studies on intact skin involving over 1300 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated subjects one or more such local reactions were noted in 56% of patients and were generally mild and transient resolving spontaneously within 1 or 2 hours. There were no serious reactions that were ascribed to lidocaine and prilocaine cream. Two recent reports describe blistering on the foreskin in neonates about to undergo circumcision. Both neonates received 1.0 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. In patients treated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin local effects observed in the trials included: paleness (pallor or blanching) 37% redness (erythema) 30% alterations in temperature sensations 7% edema 6% itching 2% and rash less than 1%. In clinical studies on genital mucous membranes involving 378 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated patients one or more application site reactions usually mild and transient were noted in 41% of patients. The most common application site reactions were redness (21%) burning sensation (17%) and edema (10%). Allergic Reactions: Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or prilocaine can occur. They are characterized by urticaria angioedema bronchospasm and shock. If they occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Systemic (Dose Related) Reactions: Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed (see Pharmacokinetics subsection of CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and/or prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness nervousness apprehension euphoria confusion dizziness drowsiness tinnitus blurred or double vision vomiting sensations of heat cold or numbness twitching tremors convulsions unconsciousness respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness.

Benazepril hydrochloride has been evaluated for safety in over 6000 patients with hypertension> over 700 of these patients were treated for at least one year. The overall incidence of reported adverse events was similar in benazepril hydrochloride and placebo patients. The reported side effects were generally mild and transient and there was no relation between side effects and age duration of therapy or total dosage within the range of 2 to 80 mg. Discontinuation of therapy because of a side effect was required in approximately 5% of U.S. patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride and in 3% of patients treated with placebo. The most common reasons for discontinuation were headache (0.6%) and cough (0.5%). Adverse reactions seen in at least 1% greater frequency in patients treated with benazepril hydrochloride than placebo were headache (6% vs. 4%) dizziness (4% vs. 2%) somnolence (2% vs. 0%) and postural dizziness (2% vs. 0%). Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials (less than 1% more on benazepril than on placebo) and rarer events seen in post-marketing experience include the following (in some a causal relationship to drug use is uncertain): Dermatologic: Stevens-Johnson syndrome pemphigus apparent hypersensitivity reactions (manifested by dermatitis pruritus or rash) photosensitivity and flushing.

Adult Patients During clinical investigations with oral and parenteral ciprofloxacin 49038 patients received courses of the drug. The most frequently reported adverse reactions from clinical trials of all formulations all dosages all drug-therapy durations and for all indications of ciprofloxacin therapy were nausea (2.5%) diarrhea (1.6%) liver function tests abnormal (1.3%) vomiting (1%) and rash (1%).

Pediatric Patients Short (6 weeks) and long term (1 year) musculoskeletal and neurological safety of oral/intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of cUTI or pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 xb1 4 years) in an international multicenter trial. The duration of therapy was 10 to 21 days (mean duration of treatment was 11 days with a range of 1 to 88 days). A total of 335 ciprofloxacin- and 349 comparator-treated patients were enrolled. An Independent Pediatric Safety Committee (IPSC) reviewed all cases of musculoskeletal adverse reactions including abnormal gait or abnormal joint exam (baseline or treatment-emergent). Within 6 weeks of treatment initiation the rates of musculoskeletal adverse reactions were 9.3% (31/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 6% (21/349) in comparator-treated patients. All musculoskeletal adverse reactions occurring by 6 weeks resolved (clinical resolution of signs and symptoms) usually within 30 days of end of treatment. Radiological evaluations were not routinely used to confirm resolution of the adverse reactions. Ciprofloxacin-treated patients were more likely to report more than one adverse reaction and on more than one occasion compared to control patients. The rate of musculoskeletal adverse reactions was consistently higher in the ciprofloxacin group compared to the control group across all age subgroups. At the end of 1 year the rate of these adverse reactions reported at any time during that period was 13.7% (46/335) in the ciprofloxacin-treated group versus 9.5% (33/349) in the comparator-treated patients (Table 9). Table 9: Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions1 as Assessed by the IPSC 1. Included: arthralgia abnormal gait abnormal joint exam joint sprains leg pain back pain arthrosis bone pain pain myalgia arm pain and decreased range of motion in a joint (knee elbow ankle hip wrist and shoulder) 2. The study was designed to demonstrate that the arthropathy rate for the ciprofloxacin group did not exceed that of the control group by more than + 6%. At both the 6 week and 1 year evaluations the 95% confidence interval indicated that it could not be concluded that the ciprofloxacin group had findings comparable to the control group. Ciprofloxacin Comparator All Patients (within 6 weeks) 31/335 (9.3%) 21/349 (6%) 95% Confidence Interval2 (-0.8% +7.2%) Age Group 12 months <> 24 months 1/36 (2.8%) 0/41 2 years <> 6 years 5/124 (4%) 3/118 (2.5%) 6 years <> 12 years 18/143 (12.6%) 12/153 (7.8%) 12 years to 17 years 7/32 (21.9%) 6/37 (16.2%) All Patients (within 1 year) 46/335 (13.7%) 33/349 (9.5%) 95% Confidence Interval1 (-0.6% + 9.1%) The incidence rates of neurological adverse reactions within 6 weeks of treatment initiation were 3% (9/335) in the ciprofloxacin group versus 2% (7/349) in the comparator group and included dizziness nervousness insomnia and somnolence. In this trial the overall incidence rates of adverse reactions within 6 weeks of treatment initiation were 41% (138/335) in the ciprofloxacin group versus 31% (109/349) in the comparator group. The most frequent adverse reactions were gastrointestinal: 15% (50/335) of ciprofloxacin patients compared to 9% (31/349) of comparator patients. Serious adverse reactions were seen in 7.5% (25/335) of ciprofloxacin-treated patients compared to 5.7% (20/349) of control patients. Discontinuation of drug due to an adverse reaction was observed in 3% (10/335) of ciprofloxacin-treated patients versus 1.4% (5/349) of comparator patients. Other adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of ciprofloxacin patients were diarrhea 4.8% vomiting 4.8% abdominal pain 3.3% dyspepsia 2.7% nausea 2.7% fever 2.1% asthma 1.8% and rash 1.8%. Short-term safety data for ciprofloxacin was also collected in a randomized double-blind clinical trial for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients (ages 5 to 17 years). Sixty-seven patients received ciprofloxacin IV 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for one week followed by ciprofloxacin tablets 20 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours to complete 10 to 21 days treatment and 62 patients received the combination of ceftazidime intravenous 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours and tobramycin intravenous 3 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for a total of 10 to 21 days. Periodic musculoskeletal assessments were conducted by treatment-blinded examiners. Patients were followed for an average of 23 days after completing treatment (range 0 to 93 days). Musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 22% of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 21% in the comparison group. Decreased range of motion was reported in 12% of the subjects in the ciprofloxacin group and 16% in the comparison group. Arthralgia was reported in 10% of the patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 11% in the comparison group. Other adverse reactions were similar in nature and frequency between treatment arms. The efficacy of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients has not been established. In addition to the adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials it should be expected that adverse reactions reported in adults during clinical trials or postmarketing experience may also occur in pediatric patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide marketing experience with fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 10).

a7e55c43-4345-4710-e053-2995a90aeee7,ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component the anti-infective component or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available since no denominator of treated patients is available. Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredient are allergic sensitizations. The reactions due to the steroid component are: elevation of IOP with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage> posterior subcapsular cataract formation> and delayed wound healing. Secondary Infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroid. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Keratitis conjunctivitis corneal ulcers and conjunctival hyperemia have occasionally been reported following use of steroids. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1473 patients on oral pantoprazole sodium (20 mg or 40 mg) 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist 46 patients on another PPI and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE> however as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole sodium are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years the most commonly reported (>>4%) adverse reactions include: URI headache fever diarrhea vomiting rash and abdominal pain.

Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized double-blind controlled clinical trials including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control although the incidence of these events was lower (1.5%) with pioglitazone than with placebo (3%). In the PROactive trial the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers ACE inhibitors angiotensin II receptor blockers calcium channel blockers nitrates diuretics aspirin statins and fibrates). At baseline patients had a mean age of 62 years mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI stroke acute coronary syndrome cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention major leg amputation above the ankle and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.9> 95% Confidence Interval: 0.8 1.02> p=0.1). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9. Table 9.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10 and 11 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of induced hepatotoxicity with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized double-blind 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% vs. 13.4%) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% vs. 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient's usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (n=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (n=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1)]. During the three year PROactive clinical trial 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and two (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1> 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72) [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)]. Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)]. Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND

b8323987-90fe-4e6c-a71c-76e3c501713c,ADVERSE REACTIONS The dofetilide clinical program involved approximately 8600 patients in 130 clinical studies of normal volunteers and patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Dofetilide was administered to 5194 patients including two large placebo-controlled mortality trials (DIAMOND CHF and DIAMOND MI) in which 1511 patients received dofetilide for up to three years. In the following section adverse reaction data for cardiac arrhythmias and non-cardiac adverse reactions are presented separately for patients included in the supraventricular arrhythmia development program and for patients included in the DIAMOND CHF and MI mortality trials (see CLINICAL STUDIES Safety in Patients with Structural Heart Disease DIAMOND Studies for a description of these trials). In studies of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias a total of 1346 and 677 patients were exposed to dofetilide and placebo for 551 and 207 patient years respectively. A total of 8.7% of patients in the dofetilide groups were discontinued from clinical trials due to adverse events compared to 8.0% in the placebo groups. The most frequent reason for discontinuation (>>1%) was ventricular tachycardia (2.0% on dofetilide vs. 1.3% on placebo). The most frequent adverse events were headache chest pain and dizziness. Serious Arrhythmias and Conduction Disturbances: Torsade de Pointes is the only arrhythmia that showed a dose-response relationship to dofetilide treatment. It did not occur in placebo treated patients. The incidence of Torsade de Pointes in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias was 0.8% (11/1346) (see WARNINGS ). The incidence of Torsade de Pointes in patients who were dosed according to the recommended dosing regimen (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) was 0.8% (4/525). Table 6 shows the frequency by randomized dose of serious arrhythmias and conduction disturbances reported as adverse events in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Table 6: Incidence of Serious Arrhythmias and Conduction Disturbances in Patients with Supraventricular Arrhythmias * Patients with more than one arrhythmia are counted only once in this category. ^ Ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia include all cases of Torsade de Pointes. In the DIAMOND trials a total of 1511 patients were exposed to dofetilide for 1757 patient years. The incidence of Torsade de Pointes was 3.3% in CHF patients and 0.9% in patients with a recent MI. Table 7 shows the incidence of serious arrhythmias and conduction disturbances reported as adverse events in the DIAMOND subpopulation that had AF at entry to these trials. Table 7: Incidence of Serious Arrhythmias and Conduction Disturbances in Patients with AF at Entry to the DIAMOND Studies * Patients with more than one arrhythmia are counted only once in this category. ^ Ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia include all cases of Torsade de Pointes. Other Adverse Reactions: Table 8 presents other adverse events reported with a frequency of >>2% on dofetilide and reported numerically more frequently on dofetilide than on placebo in the studies of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. Table 8: Frequency of Adverse Events Occurring at >>2% on Dofetilide and Numerically More Frequently on Dofetilide than Placebo in Patients with Supraventricular Arrhythmias Adverse events reported at a rate >>2% but no more frequently on dofetilide than on placebo were: angina pectoris anxiety arthralgia asthenia atrial fibrillation complications (application injection incision insertion or device) hypertension pain palpitation peripheral edema supraventricular tachycardia sweating urinary tract infection ventricular tachycardia.

8de04bf2-83dd-c494-e053-2a95a90abade,6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in 858 patients treated for essential hypertension and 3889 patients treated for hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 2.8% and 2.3% of patients treated with the combination and placebo respectively. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials adverse reactions occurring in greater than 2% of subjects treated with losartan and hydrochlorothiazide and at a greater rate than placebo were: back pain (2.1% vs 0.6%) dizziness (5.7% vs 2.9%) and upper respiratory infection (6.1% vs 4.6%). The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide and/or the individual components: Blood and the lymphatic system disorders: Anemia aplastic anemia hemolytic anemia leukopenia agranulocytosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Anorexia hyperglycemia hyperuricemia electrolyte imbalance including hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Psychiatric disorders: Insomnia restlessness. Nervous system disorders: Dysgeusia headache migraine paraesthesias. Eye disorders: Xanthopsia transient blurred vision. Cardiac disorders: Palpitation tachycardia. Vascular disorders: Dose-related orthostatic effects necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis cutaneous vasculitis). Respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Nasal congestion pharyngitis sinus disorder respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema). Gastrointestinal disorders: Dyspepsia abdominal pain gastric irritation cramping diarrhea constipation nausea vomiting pancreatitis sialoadenitis. Hepato-biliary disorders: Jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice). Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash pruritus purpura toxic epidermal necrolysis urticaria photosensitivity cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Muscle cramps muscle spasm myalgia arthralgia. Renal and urinary disorders: Glycosuria renal dysfunction interstitial nephritis renal failure. Reproductive system and breast disorders: Erectile dysfunction/impotence. General disorders and administration site conditions: Chest pain edema/swelling malaise fever weakness. Investigations: Liver function abnormalities. Cough Persistent dry cough has been associated with ACE-inhibitor use and in practice can be a cause of discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Two prospective parallel-group double-blind randomized controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who had experienced cough while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. Patients who had typical ACE-inhibitor cough when challenged with lisinopril whose cough disappeared on placebo were randomized to losartan 50 mg lisinopril 20 mg or either placebo (one study n=97) or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n=135). The double-blind treatment period lasted up to 8 weeks. The incidence of cough is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: *Demographics = (89% Caucasian 64% female) u2020 Demographics = (90% Caucasian 51% female) Study 1* HCTZ Losartan Lisinopril Cough 25% 17% 69% Study2u2020 Placebo Losartan Lisinopril Cough 35% 29% 62% These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy in a population that all had cough associated with ACE-inhibitor therapy is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy. Cases of cough including positive re-challenges have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Digestive: Hepatitis has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan. Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity: Angioedema including swelling of the larynx and glottis causing airway obstruction and/or swelling of the face lips pharynx and/or tongue has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan> some of these patients previously experienced angioedema with other drugs including ACE inhibitors.

91d45625-5ba6-b50f-e053-2a95a90ac314,The following risks are discussed in more detail in others sections: Hypotension and Worsening Renal Function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Electrolyte and Metabolic Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In pre-approval studies torsemide has been evaluated for safety in approximately 4000 subjects> over 800 of these subjects received torsemide for at least 6 months and over 380 were treated for more than 1 year. Among these subjects were 564 who received torsemide during United States-based trials in which 274 other subjects received placebo. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.5% of United States patients treated with torsemide and in 4.4% of patients treated with placebo. In United States placebo-controlled trials excessive urination occurred in 6.7% of patients compared with 2.2% of patients receiving placebo. The daily doses of torsemide used in these trials ranged from 1.25 mg to 20 mg with most patients receiving 5 mg to 10 mg> the duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 52 days with a median of 41 days. In the placebo-controlled hypertension studies excessive urination was dose related> 1% of patients receiving placebo 4% of those treated with 5 mg of daily torsemide and 15% of those treated with 10 mg. Excessive urination was generally not reported as an adverse event among patients who received torsemide for cardiac renal or hepatic failure. There was no effect of age or sex on the incidence of adverse reactions. Laboratory Parameters Potassium In controlled studies in the United States torsemide was administered to hypertensive patients at doses of 5 mg or 10 mg daily. After 6 weeks at these doses the mean decrease in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEq/L. The percentage of patients who had a serum potassium level below 3.5 mEq/L at any time during the studies was 1.5% on torsemide and 3% on placebo. In patients followed for 1 year there was no progressive change in mean serum potassium levels. In patients with congestive heart failure hepatic cirrhosis or renal disease treated with torsemide at doses higher than those studied in United States antihypertensive trials hypokalemia was observed with greater frequency in a dose-related manner. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Creatinine and Uric Acid Torsemide produces small dose-related increases in each of these laboratory values. In hypertensive patients who received 10 mg of torsemide daily for 6 weeks the mean increase in blood urea nitrogen was 1.8 mg/dL (0.6 mmol/L) the mean increase in serum creatinine was 0.05 mg/dL (4 mmol/L) and the mean increase in serum uric acid was 1.2 mg/dL (70 mmol/L). Little further change occurred with long-term treatment and all changes reversed when treatment was discontinued. Glucose Hypertensive patients who received 10 mg of daily torsemide experienced a mean increase in serum glucose concentration of 5.5 mg/dL (0.3 mmol/L) after 6 weeks of therapy with a further increase of 1.8 mg/dL (0.1 mmol/L) during the subsequent year. In long-term studies in diabetics mean fasting glucose values were not significantly changed from baseline. Serum Lipids Torsemide 20 mg caused small increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides in short term hypertension studies. The changes subsided with chronic therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post-approval use of torsemide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal system: Pancreatitis abdominal pain Nervous System: Paresthesia confusion visual impairment loss of appetite Hematologic: Leucopenia thrombocytopenia anemia Hepatobiliary: Increase in liver transaminases gamma-glutamyltransferase Metabolism: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency Skin/hypersensitivity: Stevens-Johnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis photosensitivity reaction pruritus Urogenital: Acute urinary retention,"risks,  hypotension, worsening, renal function, electrolyte, metabolic abnormalities, ototoxicity, conditions, reaction,      practice, pre-approval studies, torsemide,  subjects  torsemide, months, treated   torsemide, states-based  placebo, discontinuation therapy, states,  torsemide,  placebo, excessive, urination, compared, placebo, daily, doses, torsemide, duration treatment, days, median days, placebo-controlled hypertension, excessive, urination dose, placebo,  torsemide,  excessive, urination, event, torsemide, cardiac renal hepatic failure, age sex,  reactions, laboratory parameters, potassium studies, torsemide, administered, hypertensive, daily, weeks, doses, decrease, serum potassium, time studies, torsemide, placebo, progressive, congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, renal disease,  torsemide, doses, states antihypertensive, hypokalemia, frequency, dose-related, blood urea, nitrogen bun, creatinine, uric acid, torsemide, laboratory values, hypertensive, torsemide, daily, weeks, increase, blood urea, increase, serum creatinine, increase, serum, uric acid, long-term, treatment, reversed, treatment, glucose hypertensive, daily, torsemide, increase, serum glucose, weeks, therapy, increase,  long-term, studies, diabetics, fasting, baseline, serum lipids, torsemide, total cholesterol triglycerides short term hypertension, studies, chronic therapy, postmarketing, post-approval, torsemide, voluntarily   estimate, frequency, relationship, drug exposure, gastrointestinal system, pancreatitis, abdominal pain, nervous system paresthesia, confusion, visual impairment, loss appetite, hematologic leucopenia thrombocytopenia, hepatobiliary, increase, liver transaminases, gamma-glutamyltransferase metabolism, thiamine, vitamin deficiency, skin hypersensitivity, stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic, epidermal necrolysis, photosensitivity reaction, urogenital acute, urinary retention"

A higher percentage of rosuvastatin-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients 6.6% and 6.2% respectively discontinued study medication due to an adverse event irrespective of treatment causality. Myalgia was the most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation. There was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c >> 6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g. memory loss forgetfulness amnesia memory impairment confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious and reversible upon statin discontinuation with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 w,"detail  rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, acute renal failure myopathy, myositis, liver enzyme abnormalities, studies, studies, conditions, reaction, studies,   studies,   practice, rosuvastatin, calcium database, placebo, weeks, discontinued, reactions, treatment, myalgia abdominal pain nausea,  rosuvastatin, calcium trial database, headache myalgia, abdominal pain asthenia, nausea placebo-controlled studies, placebo, studies, treatment, weeks,  rosuvastatin, calcium placebo, placebo-controlled rosuvastatin calcium, rosuvastatin, calcium, rosuvastatin, calcium, rosuvastatin, calcium, rosuvastatin, calcium, placebo, headache, nausea, myalgia, asthenia, constipation, studies, abdominal pain, dizziness hypersensitivity, rash pruritus urticaria angioedema pancreatitis, laboratory abnormalities, dipstick-positive proteinuria microscopic hematuria, elevated, creatine phosphokinase transaminases glucose glutamyl transpeptidase alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin,  participants,  rosuvastatin, placebo, mean treatment duration,    rosuvastatin, calcium,  reactions, treatment, myalgia hepatic enzyme headache nausea, rate, placebo,  rosuvastatin, calcium placebo  rosuvastatin, calcium, placebo, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, dizziness, cpk, abdominal pain, alt, meddra, abnormal, laboratory value,  participants,  rosuvastatin, placebo, mean duration  rosuvastatin- placebo- discontinued, study, medication, event, treatment, myalgia reaction, treatment discontinuation, frequency diabetes mellitus, rosuvastatin, placebo, rosuvastatin- placebo-  rosuvastatin- placebo- rate, placebo,  rosuvastatin, calcium placebo  rosuvastatin, calcium, placebo, myalgia, arthralgia, constipation, diabetes mellitus, nausea, meddra, postmarketing, identified, postapproval, rosuvastatin, calcium arthralgia, fatal, non-fatal, hepatic failure, hepatitis jaundice thrombocytopenia, depression sleep disorders, insomnia nightmares, peripheral neuropathy, interstitial lung disease gynecomastia, voluntarily   estimate, frequency, relationship, drug exposure, reports, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, statin, postmarketing, cognitive impairment, memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, statin, cognitive issues, statins, reports, nonserious reversible, statin, discontinuation, symptom, day,  symptom, resolution"
a7bd3e3c-26e9-07e7-e053-2995a90a9ca5,The following are described in more detail in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section of the label: Complex Sleep Behaviors [see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] CNS Depressant Effects and Next-Day Impairment [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4)] Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)] Withdrawal Effects [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)] Timing of Drug Administration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)] Special Populations [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.8)] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The premarketing development program for eszopiclone included eszopiclone exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from two different groups of studies: approximately 400 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies and approximately 1550 patients in placebo-controlled clinical effectiveness studies corresponding to approximately 263 patient-exposure years. The conditions and duration of treatment with eszopiclone varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies inpatients and outpatients and short-term and longer-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events results of physical examinations vital signs weights laboratory analyses and ECGs. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while the patient was receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Adverse Reactions Resulting in Discontinuation of Treatment In placebo-controlled parallel-group clinical trials in the elderly 3.8% of 208 patients who received placebo 2.3% of 215 patients who received 2 mg eszopiclone and 1.4% of 72 patients who received 1 mg eszopiclone discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction. In the 6-week parallel-group study in adults no patients in the 3 mg arm discontinued because of an adverse reaction. In the long-term 6-month study in adult insomnia patients 7.2% of 195 patients who received placebo and 12.8% of 593 patients who received 3 mg eszopiclone discontinued due to an adverse reaction. No reaction that resulted in discontinuation occurred at a rate of greater than 2%. Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of >2% in Controlled Trials Table 1 shows the incidence of adverse reactions from a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study of eszopiclone at doses of 2 or 3 mg in nonelderly adults. Treatment duration in this trial was 44 days. The table includes only reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with eszopiclone 2 mg or 3 mg in which the incidence in patients treated with eszopiclone was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. Table 1: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions in a 6-Week Placebo-Controlled Study in Nonelderly Adults with Eszopiclone1 1Reactions for which the eszopiclone incidence was equal to or less than placebo are not listed on the table but included the following: abnormal dreams accidental injury back pain diarrhea flu syndrome myalgia pain pharyngitis and rhinitis. * Gender-specific adverse reaction in females u2020 Gender-specific adverse reaction in males Adverse Reactions Placebo (n=99) Eszopiclone 2 mg (n=104) Eszopiclone 3 mg (n=105) Body as a Whole Headache 13 21 17 Viral Infection 1 3 3 Digestive System Dry Mouth 3 5 7 Dyspepsia 4 4 5 Nausea 4 5 4 Vomiting 1 3 0 Nervous System Anxiety 0 3 1 Confusion 0 0 3 Depression 0 4 1 Dizziness 4 5 7 Hallucinations 0 1 3 Libido Decreased 0 0 3 Nervousness 3 5 0 Somnolence 3 10 8 Respiratory System Infection 3 5 10 Skin and Appendages Rash 1 3 4 Special Senses Unpleasant Taste 3 17 34 Urogenital System Dysmenorrhea* 0 3 0 Gynecomastiau2020 0 3 0 Adverse reactions from Table 1 that suggest a dose-response relationship in adults include viral infection dry mouth dizziness hallucinations infection rash and unpleasant taste with this relationship clearest for unpleasant taste. Table 2 shows the incidence of adverse reactions from combined Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies of eszopiclone at doses of 1 or 2 mg in elderly adults (ages 65 to 86). Treatment duration in these trials was 14 days. The table includes only reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with eszopiclone 1 mg or 2 mg in which the incidence in patients treated with eszopiclone was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. Table 2: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions in Elderly Adults (Ages 65 to 86) in 2-Week Placebo-Controlled Trials with Eszopiclone1 Table 2: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions in Elderly Adults (Ages 65 to 86 Years) in 2-Week Placebo-Controlled Trials with Eszopiclone1 1Reactions for which the eszopiclone incidence was equal to or less than placebo are not listed on the table but included the following: abdominal pain asthenia nausea rash and somnolence.

These figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse reactions in the course of usual medical practice because patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse reaction incidence rate in the population studied. Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Eszopiclone Following is a list of modified COSTART terms that reflect adverse reactions as defined in the introduction to the Adverse Reactions section and reported by approximately 1550 subjects treated with eszopiclone at doses in the range of 1 to 3.5 mg/day during Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials throughout the United States and Canada. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in Tables 1 and 2 or elsewhere in labeling minor reactions common in the general population and reactions unlikely to be drug related. Although the reactions reported occurred during treatment with eszopiclone they were not necessarily caused by it. Reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those that occurred on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse reactions are those that occurred in fewer than 1/100 patients but in at least 1/1000 patients> rare adverse reactions are those that occurred in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Gender-specific reactions are categorized based on their incidence for the appropriate gender.

1cbe2bbe-56e3-4904-93d9-d9c3c0daa165,ADVERSE REACTIONS (See also PRECAUTIONS .) Commonly Observed The more commonly observed untoward events associated with the use of buspirone hydrochloride tablets not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients include dizziness nausea headache nervousness lightheadedness and excitement. Associated With Discontinuation of Treatment One guide to the relative clinical importance of adverse events associated with buspirone hydrochloride tablets is provided by the frequency with which they caused drug discontinuation during clinical testing. Approximately 10% of the 2200 anxious patients who participated in the buspirone hydrochloride tablets premarketing clinical efficacy trials in anxiety disorders lasting 3 to 4 weeks discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The more common events causing discontinuation included: central nervous system disturbances (3.4%) primarily dizziness insomnia nervousness drowsiness and lightheaded feeling> gastrointestinal disturbances (1.2%) primarily nausea> and miscellaneous disturbances (1.1%) primarily headache and fatigue. In addition 3.4% of patients had multiple complaints none of which could be characterized as primary. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials The table that follows enumerates adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 1% or more among buspirone hydrochloride patients who participated in 4 week controlled trials comparing buspirone hydrochloride tablets with placebo. The frequencies were obtained from pooled data for 17 trials. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. Comparison of the cited figures however does provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side-effect incidence rate in the population studied. 1Events reported by at least 1% of buspirone patients are included. 2Incidence less than 1%. 1 * Events reported by at least 1% of buspirone patients are included. 2 - Incidence less than 1%. Other Events Observed During the Entire Premarketing Evaluation of Buspirone Hydrochloride Tablets During its premarketing assessment buspirone hydrochloride tablets were evaluated in over 3500 subjects. This section reports event frequencies for adverse events occurring in approximately 3000 subjects from this group who took multiple doses of buspirone hydrochloride tablets in the dose range for which buspirone is being recommended (i.e. the modal daily dose of buspirone hydrochloride tablets fell between 10 and 30 mg for 70% of the patients studied) and for whom safety data were systematically collected. The conditions and duration of exposure to buspirone hydrochloride tablets varied greatly involving well-controlled studies as well as experience in open and uncontrolled clinical settings. As part of the total experience gained in clinical studies various adverse events were reported. In the absence of appropriate controls in some of the studies a causal relationship to buspirone hydrochloride treatment cannot be determined. The list includes all undesirable events reasonably associated with the use of the drug. The following enumeration by organ system describes events in terms of their relative frequency of reporting in this data base. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section. The following definitions of frequency are used: Frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients. Infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients while rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1000 patients. Cardiovascular Frequent was nonspecific chest pain> infrequent were syncope hypotension and hypertension> rare were cerebrovascular accident congestive heart failure myocardial infarction cardiomyopathy and bradycardia. Central Nervous System Frequent were dream disturbances> infrequent were depersonalization dysphoria noise intolerance euphoria akathisia fearfulness loss of interest dissociative reaction hallucinations involuntary movements slowed reaction time suicidal ideation and seizures> rare were feelings of claustrophobia cold intolerance stupor and slurred speech and psychosis. EENT Frequent were tinnitus sore throat and nasal congestion> infrequent were redness and itching of the eyes altered taste altered smell and conjunctivitis> rare were inner ear abnormality eye pain photophobia and pressure on eyes. Endocrine Rare were galactorrhea and thyroid abnormality. Gastrointestinal Infrequent were flatulence anorexia increased appetite salivation irritable colon and rectal bleeding> rare was burning of the tongue. Genitourinary Infrequent were urinary frequency urinary hesitancy menstrual irregularity and spotting and dysuria> rare were amenorrhea pelvic inflammatory disease enuresis and nocturia. Musculoskeletal Infrequent were muscle cramps muscle spasms rigid/stiff muscles and arthralgias> rare was muscle weakness. Respiratory Infrequent were hyperventilation shortness of breath and chest congestion> rare was epistaxis. Sexual Function Infrequent were decreased or increased libido> rare were delayed ejaculation and impotence. Skin Infrequent were edema pruritus flushing easy bruising hair loss dry skin facial edema and blisters> rare were acne and thinning of nails. Clinical Laboratory Infrequent were increases in hepatic aminotransferases (SGOT SGPT)> rare were eosinophilia leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Miscellaneous Infrequent were weight gain fever roaring sensation in the head weight loss and malaise> rare were alcohol abuse bleeding disturbance loss of voice and hiccoughs.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial the effects of Progesterone USP Capsules on the endometrium was studied in a total of 875 postmenopausal women. Table 6 lists adverse reactions greater than or equal to 2 percent of women who received cyclic Progesterone USP Capsules 200 mg daily (12 days per calendar month cycle) with 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens or placebo. Effects on Secondary Amenorrhea In a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial the effects of Progesterone USP Capsules on secondary amenorrhea was studied in 49 estrogen-primed postmenopausal women. Table 7 lists adverse reactions greater than or equal to 5 percent of women who received Progesterone USP Capsules or placebo. In a multicenter parallel-group open label postmarketing dosing study consisting of three consecutive 28-day treatment cycles 220 premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea were randomized to receive daily conjugated estrogens therapy (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens) and Progesterone USP Capsules 300 mg per day (n=113) or Progesterone USP Capsules 400 mg per /day (n=107) for 10 days of each treatment cycle. Overall the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 5 percent of subjects were nausea fatigue vaginal mycosis nasopharyngitis upper respiratory tract infection headache dizziness breast tenderness abdominal distension acne dysmenorrhea mood swing and urinary tract infection. Postmarketing Experience: The following additional adverse reactions have been reported with Progesterone USP Capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

769e0a3b-826d-4faf-9129-5eeb7ebe0b67,ADVERSE REACTIONS Hepatobiliary: Dose-related serum aminotransferase (mainly SGPT) elevations usually not accompanied by rises in alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin occurred in 30% or more of patients treated with the recommended dose of Chenodiol. In most cases these elevations were minor (1 xbd to 3 times the upper limit of laboratory normal) and transient returning to within the normal range within six months despite continued administration of the drug. In 2% to 3% of patients SGPT levels rose to over three times the upper limit of laboratory normal recurred on rechallenge with the drug and required discontinuation of chenodiol treatment. Enzyme levels have returned to normal following withdrawal of chenodiol ( see WARNINGS ). Morphologic studies of liver biopsies taken before and after 9 and 24 months of treatment with chenodiol have shown that 63% of the patients prior to chenodiol treatment had evidence of intrahepatic cholestasis. Almost all pretreatment patients had electron microscopic abnormalities. By the ninth month of treatment reexamination of two-thirds of the patients showed an 89% incidence of the signs of intrahepatic cholestasis. Two of 89 patients at the ninth month had lithocholate-like lesions in the canalicular membrane although there were not clinical enzyme abnormalities in the face of continued treatment and no change in Type 2 light microscopic parameters. Increased Cholecystectomy Rate : NCGS patients with a history of biliary pain prior to treatment had higher cholecystectomy rates during the study if assigned to low dosage chenodiol (375 mg/day) than if assigned to either placebo or high dosage chenodiol (750 mg/day). The association with low dosage chenodiol though not clearly a causal one suggests that patients unable to take higher doses of chenodiol may be at greater risk of cholecystectomy. Gastrointestinal: Dose-related diarrhea has been encountered in 30% to 40% of chenodiol-treated patients and may occur at any time during treatment but is most commonly encountered when treatment is initiated. Usually the diarrhea is mild translucent well-tolerated and does not interfere with therapy. Dose reduction has been required in 10% to 15% of patients and in a controlled trial about half of these required a permanent reduction in dose. Anti-diarrhea agents have proven useful in some patients. Discontinuation of chenodiol because of failure to control diarrhea is to be expected in approximately 3% of patients treated. Steady epigastric pain with nausea typical of lithiasis (biliary colic) usually is easily distinguishable from the crampy abdominal pain of drug-induced diarrhea. Other less frequent gastrointestinal side effects reported include urgency cramps heartburn constipation nausea and vomiting anorexic epigastric distress dyspepsis flatulence and nonspecific abdominal pain. Serum Lipids: Serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol may rise 10% or more during administration of chenodiol: no change has been seen in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction> small decreases in serum triglyceride levels for females have been reported.

1474d1df-70b6-4b1e-86d1-3349aa6d42fb,ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension 1%. Because reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions include elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage posterior subcapsular cataract formation and delayed wound healing. The development of secondary ocular infection (bacterial fungal and viral) has occurred. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion should be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used (see PRECAUTIONS ). Other adverse reactions reported with the use of prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension include: allergic reactions> dysgeusia> eye pain> foreign body sensation> headache> pruritus> rash> transient burning and stinging upon instillation and other minor symptoms of ocular irritation> urticaria> and visual disturbance (blurry vision).

Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole patients should be specifically warned about these reactions and should be told to stop the drug and report immediately to their physicians if any neurologic symptoms occur. In addition patients have reported headache syncope dizziness vertigo incoordination ataxia confusion dysarthria irritability depression weakness and insomnia (see WARNINGS ). The following reactions have also been reported during treatment with metronidazole injection: Gastrointestinal The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract particularly nausea sometimes accompanied by headache anorexia and occasionally vomiting diarrhea> epigastric distress> abdominal cramping> and constipation. Mouth A sharp unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue glossitis and stomatitis have occurred> these may be associated with a sudden overgrowth of Candida which may occur during effective therapy. Dermatologic Erythematous rash and pruritus. Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia)> rarely reversible thrombocytopenia. Local Reactions Thrombophlebitis after intravenous infusion. This reaction can be minimized or avoided by avoiding prolonged use of indwelling intravenous catheters. Cardiovascular Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Hypersensitivity Urticaria erythematous rash Stevens-Johnson Syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis flushing nasal congestion dryness of the mouth (or vagina or vulva) and fever. Renal Dysuria cystitis polyuria incontinence and a sense of pelvic pressure. Instances of darkened urine have been reported by approximately one patient in 100000. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance. Other Proliferation of Candida in the vagina dyspareunia decrease of libido proctitis and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling ""serum sickness."" Rare cases of pancreatitis which abated on withdrawal of the drug have been reported. Patients with Crohn's disease are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers.

b272ef9c-4d83-4ee2-b9cc-477440822cca,ADVERSE REACTIONS Cefoxitin for Injection is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse reactions have been local reactions following intravenous injection. Other adverse reactions have been encountered infrequently. Local Reactions Thrombophlebitis has occurred with intravenous administration. Allergic Reactions Rash (including exfoliative dermatitis and toxic epidermal necrolysis) urticaria flushing pruritus eosinophilia fever dyspnea and other allergic reactions including anaphylaxis interstitial nephritis and angioedema have been noted. Cardiovascular Hypotension. Gastrointestinal Diarrhea including documented pseudomembranous colitis which can appear during or after antibiotic treatment. Nausea and vomiting have been reported rarely. Neuromuscular Possible exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. Blood Eosinophilia leukopenia including granulocytopenia neutropenia anemia including hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia and bone marrow depression. A positive direct Coombs test may develop in some individuals especially those with azotemia. Liver Function Transient elevations in SGOT SGPT serum LDH and serum alkaline phosphatase> and jaundice have been reported. Renal Function Elevations in serum creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen levels have been observed. As with the cephalosporins acute renal failure has been reported rarely. The role of Cefoxitin for Injection in changes in renal function tests is difficult to assess since factors predisposing to prerenal azotemia or to impaired renal function usually have been present. In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with Cefoxitin for Injection the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory test results have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics: Urticaria erythema multiforme Stevens-Johnson syndrome serum sickness-like reactions abdominal pain colitis renal dysfunction toxic nephropathy false-positive test for urinary glucose hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis elevated bilirubin aplastic anemia hemorrhage prolonged prothrombin time pancytopenia agranulocytosis superinfection vaginitis including vaginal candidiasis.

The more common events (> 1%) associated with discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. those events associated with dropout at a rate approximately twice or greater for venlafaxine compared to placebo) included: Incidence in Controlled Trials Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Controlled Clinical Trials The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of venlafaxine (incidence of 5% or greater) and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients (i.e. incidence for venlafaxine at least twice that for placebo) derived from the 1% incidence table below were asthenia sweating nausea constipation anorexia vomiting somnolence dry mouth dizziness nervousness anxiety tremor and blurred vision as well as abnormal ejaculation/orgasm and impotence in men. Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Venlafaxine-Treated Patients The table that follows enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more and were more frequent than in the placebo group among venlafaxine-treated patients who participated in short-term (4- to 8-week) placebo-controlled trials in which patients were administered doses in a range of 75 to 375 mg/day. This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least one episode of an event at some time during their treatment. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied. Dose Dependency of Adverse Events A comparison of adverse event rates in a fixed-dose study comparing venlafaxine hydrochloride 75 mg/day 225 mg/day and 375 mg/day with placebo revealed a dose dependency for some of the more common adverse events associated with venlafaxine use as shown in the table that follows. The rule for including events was to enumerate those that occurred at an incidence of 5% or more for at least one of the venlafaxine groups and for which the incidence was at least twice the placebo incidence for at least one venlafaxine group. Tests for potential dose relationships for these events (Cochran-Armitage Test with a criterion of exact 2-sided p-value < 0.05) suggested a dose-dependency for several adverse events in this list including chills hypertension anorexia nausea agitation dizziness somnolence tremor yawning sweating and abnormal ejaculation. Adaptation to Certain Adverse Events Over a 6-week period there was evidence of adaptation to some adverse events with continued therapy (e.g. dizziness and nausea) but less to other effects (e.g. abnormal ejaculation and dry mouth). Vital Sign Changes Venlafaxine hydrochloride treatment (averaged over all dose groups) in clinical trials was associated with a mean increase in pulse rate of approximately 3 beats per minute compared to no change for placebo. In a flexible-dose study with doses in the range of 200 to 375 mg/day and mean dose greater than 300 mg/day the mean pulse was increased by about 2 beats per minute compared with a decrease of about 1 beat per minute for placebo. In controlled clinical trials venlafaxine was associated with mean increases in diastolic blood pressure ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 mm Hg averaged over all dose groups compared to mean decreases ranging from 0.9 to 3.8 mm Hg for placebo. However there is a dose dependency for blood pressure increase (see WARNINGS ). Laboratory Changes Of the serum chemistry and hematology parameters monitored during clinical trials with venlafaxine a statistically significant difference with placebo was seen only for serum cholesterol. In premarketing trials treatment with venlafaxine tablets was associated with a mean final on-therapy increase in total cholesterol of 3 mg/dL. Patients treated with venlafaxine tablets for at least 3 months in placebo-controlled 12-month extension trials had a mean final on-therapy increase in total cholesterol of 9.1 mg/dL compared with a decrease of 7.1 mg/dL among placebo-treated patients. This increase was duration dependent over the study period and tended to be greater with higher doses. Clinically relevant increases in serum cholesterol defined as 1) a final on-therapy increase in serum cholesterol > 50 mg/dL from baseline and to a value > 261 mg/dL or 2) an average on-therapy increase in serum cholesterol > 50 mg/dL from baseline and to a value > 261 mg/dL were recorded in 5.3% of venlafaxine-treated patients and 0.0% of placebo-treated patients (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Serum Cholesterol Elevation ). ECG Changes In an analysis of ECGs obtained in 769 patients treated with venlafaxine and 450 patients treated with placebo in controlled clinical trials the only statistically significant difference observed was for heart rate i.e. a mean increase from baseline of 4 beats per minute for venlafaxine. In a flexible-dose study with doses in the range of 200 to 375 mg/day and mean dose greater than 300 mg/day the mean change in heart rate was 8.5 beats per minute compared with 1.7 beats per minute for placebo (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness ). Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Venlafaxine During its premarketing assessment multiple doses of venlafaxine tablets were administered to 2897 patients in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. In addition in premarketing assessment of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules multiple doses were administered to 705 patients in Phase 3 major depressive disorder studies and venlafaxine tablets were administered to 96 patients. During its premarketing assessment multiple doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were also administered to 1381 patients in Phase 3 GAD studies and 277 patients in Phase 3 Social Anxiety Disorder studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to venlafaxine in both development programs varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies uncontrolled and controlled studies inpatient (venlafaxine tablets only) and outpatient studies fixed-dose and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented therefore represent the proportion of the 5356 patients exposed to multiple doses of either formulation of venlafaxine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving venlafaxine. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 2 and those events for which a drug cause was remote. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with venlafaxine they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

a683e58a-63ea-44b8-a326-1a99a537bcf2,"ADVERSE REACTIONS (see WARNINGS ) The safety of Ovidrel was examined in four clinical studies that treated 752 patients of whom 335 received Ovidrel 250 xb5g following follicular recruitment with gonadotropins. When patients enrolled in four clinical studies (3 in ART and one in OI) were injected subcutaneously with either Ovidrel or an approved urinary-derived hCG 14.6 % (49 of 335 patients) in the Ovidrel 250 xb5g group experienced application site disorders compared to 28% (92 of 328 patients) in the approved u-hCG group. Adverse events reported for Ovidrel 250 xb5g occurring in at least 2% of patients (regardless of causality) are listed in Table 9 for the 3 ART studies and in Table 10 for the single OI study. Adverse events not listed in Table 9 that occurred in less than 2% of patients treated with Ovidrel 250 xb5g whether or not considered causally related to Ovidrel included: injection site inflammation and reaction flatulence diarrhea hiccup ectopic pregnancy breast pain intermenstrual bleeding vaginal hemorrhage cervical lesion leukorrhea ovarian hyperstimulation uterine disorders vaginitis vaginal discomfort body pain back pain fever dizziness headache hot flashes malaise paraesthesias rash emotional lability insomnia upper respiratory tract infection cough dysuria urinary tract infection urinary incontinence albuminuria cardiac arrhythmia genital moniliasis genital herpes leukocytosis heart murmur and cervical carcinoma. Additional adverse events not listed in Table 10 that occurred in less than 2% of patients treated with Ovidrel 250 xb5g whether or not considered causally related to Ovidrel included: breast pain flatulence abdominal enlargement pharyngitis upper respiratory tract infection hyperglycemia and pruritis. The following medical events have been reported subsequent to pregnancies resulting from hCG therapy in controlled clinical studies: Spontaneous Abortion Ectopic Pregnancy Premature Labor Postpartum Fever Congenital Abnormalities Of 125 clinical pregnancies reported following treatment with FSH and Ovidrel 250 xb5g or 500 xb5g three were associated with a congenital anomaly of the fetus or newborn. Among patients receiving Ovidrel 250 xb5g cranial malformation was detected in the fetus of one woman and a chromosomal abnormality (47 XXX) in another. These events were judged by the investigators to be of unlikely or unknown relation to treatment. These three events represent an incidence of major congenital malformations of 2.4% which is consistent with the reported rate for pregnancies resulting from natural or assisted conception. In a woman who received Ovidrel 500 xb5g one birth in a set of triplets was associated with Down's syndrome and atrial septal defect. This event was considered to be unrelated to the study drug. The following adverse reactions have been previously reported during menotropin therapy: Pulmonary and vascular complications (see "" Warnings "" ) Adnexal torsion (as a complication of ovarian enlargement) Mild to moderate ovarian enlargement Hemoperitoneum There have been infrequent reports of ovarian neoplasms both benign and malignant in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for ovulation induction> however a causal relationship has not been established. Post-Marketing Experience In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials the following events have been reported during post-marketing use of Ovidrel . Therefore these events were reported from a population of uncertain size the frequency or causal relationship to Ovidrel cannot be reliably determined. Cases of allergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions and mild reversible skin rashes have been reported in patients treated with Ovidrel since market introduction.

28ccedba-99cd-49f3-a782-798df5258524,ADVERSE REACTIONS Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea vomiting diarrhea) may occur but disappear when the dosage is reduced. Allergic dermatitis giddiness and hypotension have been reported occasionally. Hypotension has been observed when intravenous injection is too rapid. To avoid this response the solution should not be injected more rapidly than 1 mL per minute. Worldwide Postmarketing Reports: Thromboembolic events (e.g. deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism cerebral thrombosis acute renal cortical necrosis and central retinal artery and vein obstruction) have been rarely reported in patients receiving tranexamic acid for indications other than hemorrhage prevention in patients with hemophilia. Convulsion chromatopsia and visual impairment have also been reported. However due to the spontaneous nature of the reporting of medical events and the lack of controls the actual incidence and causal relationship of drug and event cannot be determined. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction have been reported that are suggestive of a causal relationship (see WARN,"gastrointestinal disturbances, nausea vomiting diarrhea, disappear, dosage, allergic dermatitis, giddiness hypotension, hypotension, intravenous, injection, response solution, injected, postmarketing, thromboembolic, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral thrombosis, acute, tranexamic acid, hemorrhage, hemophilia, convulsion chromatopsia, visual impairment, spontaneous, medical lack controls,  relationship, drug event, anaphylaxis anaphylactoid reaction, relationship"

4e2c9856-1836-49f0-9472-4dbeeb408f39,ADVERSE REACTIONS Gallbladder Abnormalities Gallbladder abnormalities especially stones and/or biliary sludge frequently develop in patients on chronic Sandostatin (octreotide acetate) therapy ( see WARNINGS ). Cardiac In acromegalics sinus bradycardia (<> 50 bpm) developed in 25%> conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during Sandostatin therapy ( see PRECAUTIONS - General) . Gastrointestinal Diarrhea loose stools nausea and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34%-61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies although only 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5%-10% of patients with other disorders. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose related but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting flatulence abnormal stools abdominal distention and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction with progressive abdominal distension severe epigastric pain abdominal tenderness and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients respectively but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 6% during Sandostatin therapy ( see PRECAUTIONS - General) . In patients without acromegaly hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7% headache in 6% and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed ( see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS) .

3c273512-84e2-2cea-b201-12345a6bd1fe,ADVERSE REACTIONS Antigenicity of dextrans is directly related to their degree of branching. Since LMD (dextran 40) has a low degree of branching it is relatively free of antigenic effect. However a few individuals have experienced mild urticarial reactions. More severe reactions consisting of severe anaphylactoid reaction generalized urticaria tightness of the chest wheezing hypotension nausea and vomiting may occur in rare instances. Symptoms and signs of adverse systemic reaction may be relieved by parenteral administration of antihistamines ephedrine or epinephrine while other means of shock therapy are instituted. The route of administration and dosages of the therapeutic agent selected will depend upon the severity and rapidity of progression of the reaction. Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response infection at the site of injection venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection extravasation and hypervolemia. If an adverse reaction does occur discontinue the infusion evaluate the patient institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary (see WARNINGS for treatment of anaphylactic shock). Post Marketing Severe reactions have been observed with Dextran 40 and Dextran 70. Reported reactions include: generalized urticaria nausea and vomiting wheezing hypotension shock and cardiac arrest (dextran-induced anaphylactoid reactions DIAR). FDA has received 94 reports of severe DIAR since 1964.

94461af3-11f1-4670-95d4-2965b9538ae3,ADVERSE REACTIONS Kidney Liver and Heart Transplantation The principal adverse reactions of cyclosporine therapy are renal dysfunction tremor hirsutism hypertension and gum hyperplasia. Hypertension Hypertension which is usually mild to moderate may occur in approximately 50% of patients following renal transplantation and in most cardiac transplant patients. Glomerular Capillary Thrombosis Glomerular capillary thrombosis has been found in patients treated with cyclosporine and may progress to graft failure. The pathologic changes resembled those seen in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome and included thrombosis of the renal microvasculature with platelet-fibrin thrombi occluding glomerular capillaries and afferent arterioles microangiopathic hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia and decreased renal function. Similar findings have been observed when other immunosuppressives have been employed post-transplantation. Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia has been reported in some but not all patients exhibiting convulsions while on cyclosporine therapy. Although magnesium-depletion studies in normal subjects suggest that hypomagnesemia is associated with neurologic disorders multiple factors including hypertension high dose methylprednisolone hypocholesterolemia and nephrotoxicity associated with high plasma concentrations of cyclosporine appear to be related to the neurological manifestations of cyclosporine toxicity. Clinical Studies In controlled studies the nature severity and incidence of the adverse events that were observed in 493 transplanted patients treated with Neoral were comparable with those observed in 208 transplanted patients who received Sandimmune in these same studies when the dosage of the two drugs was adjusted to achieve the same cyclosporine blood trough concentrations. Based on the historical experience with Sandimmune the following reactions occurred in 3% or greater of 892 patients involved in clinical trials of kidney heart and liver transplants. Among 705 kidney transplant patients treated with cyclosporine oral solution (Sandimmune) in clinical trials the reason for treatment discontinuation was renal toxicity in 5.4% infection in 0.9% lack of efficacy in 1.4% acute tubular necrosis in 1.0% lymphoproliferative disorders in 0.3% hypertension in 0.3% and other reasons in 0.7% of the patients. The following reactions occurred in 2% or less of cyclosporine-treated patients: allergic reactions anemia anorexia confusion conjunctivitis edema fever brittle fingernails gastritis hearing loss hiccups hyperglycemia migraine (Neoral) muscle pain peptic ulcer thrombocytopenia tinnitus. The following reactions occurred rarely: anxiety chest pain constipation depression hair breaking hematuria joint pain lethargy mouth sores myocardial infarction night sweats pancreatitis pruritus swallowing difficulty tingling upper GI bleeding visual disturbance weakness weight loss. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies including cyclosporine and cyclosporine -containing regimens are at increased risk of infections (viral bacterial fungal parasitic). Both generalized and localized infections can occur. Pre-existing infections may also be aggravated. Fatal outcomes have been reported. (See WARNINGS) Postmarketing Experience Kidney Liver and Heart Transplantation Hepatotoxicity Cases of hepatotoxicity and liver injury including cholestasis jaundice hepatitis and liver failure> serious and/or fatal outcomes have been reported. (See WARNINGS Hepatotoxicity) Increased Risk of Infections Cases of JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) sometimes fatal> and polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) especially BK virus resulting in graft loss have been reported. (See WARNINGS Polyoma Virus Infection) Headache including Migraine Cases of migraine have been reported. In some cases patients have been unable to continue cyclosporine however the final decision on treatment discontinuation should be made by the treating physician following the careful assessment of benefits versus risks. Pain of lower extremities Isolated cases of pain of lower extremities have been reported in association with cyclosporine. Pain of lower extremities has also been noted as part of Calcineurin-Inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) as described in the literature. Rheumatoid Arthritis The principal adverse reactions associated with the use of cyclosporine in rheumatoid arthritis are renal dysfunction (See WARNINGS) hypertension (See PRECAUTIONS) headache gastrointestinal disturbances and hirsutism/hypertrichosis. In rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials within the recommended dose range cyclosporine therapy was discontinued in 5.3% of the patients because of hypertension and in 7% of the patients because of increased creatinine. These changes are usually reversible with timely dose decrease or drug discontinuation. The frequency and severity of serum creatinine elevations increase with dose and duration of cyclosporine therapy. These elevations are likely to become more pronounced without dose reduction or discontinuation. The following adverse events occurred in controlled clinical trials: In addition the following adverse events have been reported in 1% to <>3% of the rheumatoid arthritis patients in the cyclosporine treatment group in controlled clinical trials.

In psoriasis patients treated in US controlled clinical studies within the recommended dose range cyclosporine therapy was discontinued in 1.0% of the patients because of hypertension and in 5.4% of the patients because of increased creatinine. In the majority of cases these changes were reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation of cyclosporine. There has been one reported death associated with the use of cyclosporine in psoriasis. A 27-year-old male developed renal deterioration and was continued on cyclosporine. He had progressive renal failure leading to death. Frequency and severity of serum creatinine increases with dose and duration of cyclosporine therapy. These elevations are likely to become more pronounced and may result in irreversible renal damage without dose reduction or discontinuation. The following events occurred in 1% to less than 3% of psoriasis patients treated with cyclosporine: Body as a Whole: fever flushes hot flushes Cardiovascular: chest pain Central and Peripheral Nervous System: appetite increased insomnia dizziness nervousness vertigo Gastrointestinal: abdominal distention constipation gingival bleeding Liver and Biliary System: hyperbilirubinemia Neoplasms: skin malignancies [squamous cell (0.9%) and basal cell (0.4%) carcinomas] Reticuloendothelial: platelet bleeding and clotting disorders red blood cell disorder Respiratory: infection viral and other infection Skin and Appendages: acne folliculitis keratosis pruritus rash dry skin Urinary System: micturition frequency Vision: abnormal vision Mild hypomagnesemia and hyperkalemia may occur but are asymptomatic. Increases in uric acid may occur and attacks of gout have been rarely reported. A minor and dose related hyperbilirubinemia has been observed in the absence of hepatocellular damage. Cyclosporine therapy may be associated with a modest increase of serum triglycerides or cholesterol. Elevations of triglycerides (>>750 mg/dL) occur in about 15% of psoriasis patients> elevations of cholesterol (>>300 mg/dL) are observed in less than 3% of psoriasis patients. Generally these laboratory abnormalities are reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of cyclosporine.

3dc5f411-3312-4add-8198-161eed98132b,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following reactions have been reported during treatment with metronidazole injection: Central Nervous System The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with metronidazole injection have been convulsive seizures encephalopathy aseptic meningitis optic and peripheral neuropathy the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole patients should be specifically warned about these reactions and should be told to stop the drug and report immediately to their physicians if any neurologic symptoms occur. In addition patients have reported headache syncope dizziness vertigo incoordination ataxia confusion dysarthria irritability depression weakness and insomnia (see WARNINGS ). The following reactions have also been reported during treatment with metronidazole injection: Gastrointestinal The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract particularly nausea sometimes accompanied by headache anorexia and occasionally vomiting diarrhea> epigastric distress> abdominal cramping> and constipation. Mouth A sharp unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue glossitis and stomatitis have occurred> these may be associated with a sudden overgrowth of Candida which may occur during effective therapy. Dermatologic Erythematous rash and pruritus. Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia)> rarely reversible thrombocytopenia. Local Reactions Thrombophlebitis after intravenous infusion. This reaction can be minimized or avoided by avoiding prolonged use of indwelling intravenous catheters. Cardiovascular Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Hypersensitivity Urticaria erythematous rash Stevens-Johnson Syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis flushing nasal congestion dryness of the mouth (or vagina or vulva) and fever. Renal Dysuria cystitis polyuria incontinence and a sense of pelvic pressure. Instances of darkened urine have been reported by approximately one patient in 100000. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance. Other Proliferation of Candida in the vagina dyspareunia decrease of libido proctitis and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling ""serum sickness."" Rare cases of pancreatitis which abated on withdrawal of the drug have been reported. Patients with Crohn's disease are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers. There have been some reports in the medical literature of breast and colon cancer in Crohn's disease patients who have been treated with metronidazole at high doses for extended periods of time. A cause and effect relationship has not been established.

9b73979c-c95a-4433-0a9d-f9cea3cb557f,ADVERSE REACTIONS Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with the administration of ceftazidime was low in clinical trials. The most common were local reactions following IV injection and allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently. No disulfiram-like reactions were reported. The following adverse effects from clinical trials were considered to be either related to ceftazidime therapy or were of uncertain etiology: Local Effects reported in fewer than 2% of patients were phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection (1 in 69 patients). Hypersensitivity Reactions reported in 2% of patients were pruritus rash and fever. Immediate reactions generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibacterial drugs including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely. Gastrointestinal Symptoms reported in fewer than 2% of patients were diarrhea (1 in 78) nausea (1 in 156) vomiting (1 in 500) and abdominal pain (1 in 416). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment (see WARNINGS ). Central Nervous System Reactions (fewer than 1%) included headache dizziness and paresthesia. Seizures have been reported with several cephalosporins including ceftazidime. In addition encephalopathy coma asterixis neuromuscular excitability and myoclonia have been reported in renally impaired patients treated with unadjusted dosing regimens of ceftazidime (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Less Frequent Adverse Events (fewer than 1%) were candidiasis (including oral thrush) and vaginitis. Hematologic Rare cases of hemolytic anemia have been reported. Laboratory Test Changes noted during clinical trials with ceftazidime for injection were transient and included: eosinophilia (1 in 13) positive Coombs test without hemolysis (1 in 23) thrombocytosis (1 in 45) and slight elevations in one or more of the hepatic enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST SGOT) (1 in 16) alanine aminotransferase (ALT SGPT) (1 in 15) LDH (1 in 18) GGT (1 in 19) and alkaline phosphatase (1 in 23). As with some other cephalosporins transient elevations of blood urea blood urea nitrogen and/or serum creatinine were observed occasionally. Transient leukopenia neutropenia agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia and lymphocytosis were seen very rarely. Postmarketing Experience with Ceftazidime for Injection Products In addition to the adverse events reported during clinical trials the following events have been observed during clinical practice in patients treated with tazicef and were reported spontaneously. For some of these events data are insufficient to allow an estimate of incidence or to establish causation. General Anaphylaxis> allergic reactions which in rare instances were severe (e.g. cardiopulmonary arrest)> urticaria> pain at injection site. Hepatobiliary Tract Hyperbilirubinemia jaundice. Renal and Genitourinary Renal impairment. Cephalosporin-Class Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with ceftazidime the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibacterial drugs: Adverse Reactions Colitis toxic nephropathy hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis aplastic anemia hemorrhage. Altered Laboratory Tests Prolonged prothrombin time false-positive test for urinary glucose pancytopenia.

5baaf78c-90f6-abcf-52c8-814490f3cf9f,ADVERSE REACTIONS Kidney Liver and Heart Transplantation The principal adverse reactions of cyclosporine therapy are renal dysfunction tremor hirsutism hypertension and gum hyperplasia. Hypertension Hypertension which is usually mild to moderate may occur in approximately 50% of patients following renal transplantation and in most cardiac transplant patients. Glomerular Capillary Thrombosis Glomerular capillary thrombosis has been found in patients treated with cyclosporine and may progress to graft failure. The pathologic changes resembled those seen in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome and included thrombosis of the renal microvasculature with platelet-fibrin thrombi occluding glomerular capillaries and afferent arterioles microangiopathic hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia and decreased renal function. Similar findings have been observed when other immunosuppressives have been employed post-transplantation. Hypomagnesemia Hypomagnesemia has been reported in some but not all patients exhibiting convulsions while on cyclosporine therapy. Although magnesium-depletion studies in normal subjects suggest that hypomagnesemia is associated with neurologic disorders multiple factors including hypertension high dose methylprednisolone hypocholesterolemia and nephrotoxicity associated with high plasma concentrations of cyclosporine appear to be related to the neurological manifestations of cyclosporine toxicity. Clinical Studies In controlled studies the nature severity and incidence of the adverse events that were observed in 493 transplanted patients treated with cyclosporine capsules (modified) were comparable with those observed in 208 transplanted patients who received Sandimmune in these same studies when the dosage of the two drugs was adjusted to achieve the same cyclosporine blood trough concentrations. Based on the historical experience with Sandimmune the following reactions occurred in 3% or greater of 892 patients involved in clinical trials of kidney heart and liver transplants. Among 705 kidney transplant patients treated with cyclosporine oral solution (Sandimmune ) in clinical trials the reason for treatment discontinuation was renal toxicity in 5.4% infection in 0.9% lack of efficacy in 1.4% acute tubular necrosis in 1.0% lymphoproliferative disorders in 0.3% hypertension in 0.3% and other reasons in 0.7% of the patients. The following reactions occurred in 2% or less of cyclosporine-treated patients: allergic reactions anemia anorexia confusion conjunctivitis edema fever brittle fingernails gastritis hearing loss hiccups hyperglycemia migraine (cyclosporine capsules (modified)) muscle pain peptic ulcer thrombocytopenia tinnitus. The following reactions occurred rarely: anxiety chest pain constipation depression hair breaking hematuria joint pain lethargy mouth sores myocardial infarction night sweats pancreatitis pruritus swallowing difficulty tingling upper GI bleeding visual disturbance weakness weight loss. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies including cyclosporine and cyclosporine -containing regimens are at increased risk of infections (viral bacterial fungal parasitic). Both generalized and localized infections can occur. Pre-existing infections may also be aggravated. Fatal outcomes have been reported. ( See WARNINGS ) Postmarketing Experience Kidney Liver and Heart Transplantation Hepatotoxicity Cases of hepatotoxicity and liver injury including cholestasis jaundice hepatitis and liver failure> serious and/or fatal outcomes have been reported. ( See WARNINGS Hepatotoxicity ) Increased Risk of Infections Cases of JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) sometimes fatal> and polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) especially BK virus resulting in graft loss have been reported. ( See WARNINGS Polyoma Virus Infection ) Headache including Migraine Cases of migraine have been reported. In some cases patients have been unable to continue cyclosporine however the final decision on treatment discontinuation should be made by the treating physician following the careful assessment of benefits versus risks. Pain of lower extremities Isolated cases of pain of lower extremities have been reported in association with cyclosporine. Pain of lower extremities has also been noted as part of Calcineurin-Inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) as described in the literature. Rheumatoid Arthritis The principal adverse reactions associated with the use of cyclosporine in rheumatoid arthritis are renal dysfunction ( See WARNINGS ) hypertension ( See PRECAUTIONS ) headache gastrointestinal disturbances and hirsutism/hypertrichosis. In rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials within the recommended dose range cyclosporine therapy was discontinued in 5.3% of the patients because of hypertension and in 7% of the patients because of increased creatinine. These changes are usually reversible with timely dose decrease or drug discontinuation. The frequency and severity of serum creatinine elevations increase with dose and duration of cyclosporine therapy. These elevations are likely to become more pronounced without dose reduction or discontinuation. The following adverse events occurred in controlled clinical trials: In addition the following adverse events have been reported in 1% to <>3% of the rheumatoid arthritis patients in the cyclosporine treatment group in controlled clinical trials. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth increased sweating Body as a Whole: allergy asthenia hot flushes malaise overdose procedure NOS* tumor NOS* weight decrease weight increase Cardiovascular: abnormal heart sounds cardiac failure myocardial infarction peripheral ischemia Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia neuropathy vertigo Endocrine: goiter Gastrointestinal: constipation dysphagia enanthema eructation esophagitis gastric ulcer gastritis gastroenteritis gingival bleeding glossitis peptic ulcer salivary gland enlargement tongue disorder tooth disorder Infection: abscess bacterial infection cellulitis folliculitis fungal infection herpes simplex herpes zoster renal abscess moniliasis tonsillitis viral infection Hematologic: anemia epistaxis leukopenia lymphadenopathy Liver and Biliary System: bilirubinemia Metabolic and Nutritional: diabetes mellitus hyperkalemia hyperuricemia hypoglycemia Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia bone fracture bursitis joint dislocation myalgia stiffness synovial cyst tendon disorder Neoplasms: breast fibroadenosis carcinoma Psychiatric: anxiety confusion decreased libido emotional lability impaired concentration increased libido nervousness paroniria somnolence Reproductive (Female): breast pain uterine hemorrhage Respiratory System: abnormal chest sounds bronchospasm Skin and Appendages: abnormal pigmentation angioedema dermatitis dry skin eczema nail disorder pruritus skin disorder urticaria Special Senses: abnormal vision cataract conjunctivitis deafness eye pain taste perversion tinnitus vestibular disorder Urinary System: abnormal urine hematuria increased BUN micturition urgency nocturia polyuria pyelonephritis urinary incontinence *NOS=Not Otherwise Specified Psoriasis The principal adverse reactions associated with the use of cyclosporine in patients with psoriasis are renal dysfunction headache hypertension hypertriglyceridemia hirsutism/hypertrichosis paresthesia or hyperesthesia influenza-like symptoms nausea/vomiting diarrhea abdominal discomfort lethargy and musculoskeletal or joint pain. In psoriasis patients treated in US controlled clinical studies within the recommended dose range cyclosporine therapy was discontinued in 1.0% of the patients because of hypertension and in 5.4% of the patients because of increased creatinine. In the majority of cases these changes were reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation of cyclosporine. There has been one reported death associated with the use of cyclosporine in psoriasis. A 27 year old male developed renal deterioration and was continued on cyclosporine. He had progressive renal failure leading to death. Frequency and severity of serum creatinine increases with dose and duration of cyclosporine therapy. These elevations are likely to become more pronounced and may result in irreversible renal damage without dose reduction or discontinuation. The following events occurred in 1% to less than 3% of psoriasis patients treated with cyclosporine: Body as a Whole: fever flushes hot flushes Cardiovascular: chest pain Central and Peripheral Nervous System: appetite increased insomnia dizziness nervousness vertigo Gastrointestinal: abdominal distention constipation gingival bleeding Liver and Biliary System: hyperbilirubinemia Neoplasms: skin malignancies [squamous cell (0.9%) and basal cell (0.4%) carcinomas] Reticuloendothelial: platelet bleeding and clotting disorders red blood cell disorder Respiratory: infection viral and other infection Skin and Appendages: acne folliculitis keratosis pruritus rash dry skin Urinary System: micturition frequency Vision: abnormal vision Mild hypomagnesemia and hyperkalemia may occur but are asymptomatic. Increases in uric acid may occur and attacks of gout have been rarely reported. A minor and dose related hyperbilirubinemia has been observed in the absence of hepatocellular damage. Cyclosporine therapy may be associated with a modest increase of serum triglycerides or cholesterol. Elevations of triglycerides (>>750 mg/dL) occur in about 15% of psoriasis patients> elevations of cholesterol (>>300 mg/dL) are observed in less than 3% of psoriasis patients. Generally these laboratory abnormalities are reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of cyclosporine.

11baee9b-f5ff-4671-9d38-483df70a19d2,Adverse Reactions Most of the side effects of atropine are directly related to its antimuscarinic action. Dryness of the mouth blurred vision photophobia and tachycardia commonly occur with chronic administration of therapeutic doses. Anhidrosis also may occur and produce heat intolerance or impair temperature regulation in persons living in a hot environment. Constipation and difficulty in micturition may occur in elderly patients. Occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been observed especially skin rashes which in some instances progressed to exfoliation. Adverse effects following single or repeated injections of atropine are most often the result of excessive dosage. These include palpitation dilated pupils difficulty in swallowing hot dry skin thirst dizziness restlessness tremor fatigue and ataxia. Toxic doses lead to marked palpitation restlessness and excitement hallucinations delirium and coma. Depression and circulatory collapse occur only with severe intoxication. In such cases blood pressure declines and death due to respiratory failure may ensue following paralysis and coma.,"side effects, atropine, antimuscarinic, dryness mouth, blurred, vision, chronic administration, therapeutic doses, anhidrosis, heat intolerance, temperature, regulation, persons, hot environment, constipation, difficulty, micturition, elderly,  hypersensitivity, skin rashes, progressed, exfoliation, injections, atropine, excessive, dosage, palpitation, swallowing, hot, toxic doses, palpitation restlessness, hallucinations, depression, circulatory, collapse, severe, intoxication,  blood pressure, respiratory failure, paralysis coma"

Race distribution was 91% Caucasian 8% Black and 1% of other origin. Mean age was approximately 58 years. The majority of patients were between 50 and 64 years (51%) 33% were 65 years and older and 16% were younger than 50 years of age. The most frequent adverse experiences associated with pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets were a consequence of the expected pharmacologic effects of pilocarpine. In addition the following adverse events (>3% incidence) were reported at dosages of 15-30 mg/day in the controlled clinical trials: The following events were reported with treated head and neck cancer patients at incidences of 1% to 2% at dosages of 7.5 to 30 mg/day: abnormal vision conjunctivitis dysphagia epistaxis myalgias pruritus rash sinusitis tachycardia taste perversion tremor voice alteration. The following events were reported rarely in treated head and neck cancer patients (<>1%): Causal relation is unknown.

The association with drug is uncertain. Sjogren's Syndrome Patients: In controlled studies 376 patients received pilocarpine of whom 5% were men and 95% were women. Race distribution was 84% Caucasian 9% Oriental 3% Black and 4% of other origin. Mean age was 55 years. The majority of patients were between 40 and 69 years (70%) 16% were 70 years and older and 14% were younger than 40 years of age. Of these patients 161/629 (89/376 receiving pilocarpine) were over the age of 65 years. The adverse events reported by those over 65 years and those 65 years and younger were comparable except for notable trends for urinary frequency diarrhea and dizziness. The incidences of urinary frequency and diarrhea in the elderly were about double those in the non-elderly. The incidence of dizziness was about three times as high in the elderly as in the non-elderly. These adverse experiences were not considered to be serious. In the 2 placebo-controlled studies the most common adverse events related to drug use were sweating urinary frequency chills and vasodilatation (flushing). The most commonly reported reason for patient discontinuation of treatment was sweating. Expected pharmacologic effects of pilocarpine include the following adverse experiences associated with pilocarpine hydrochloride tablets: In addition the following adverse events (>3% incidence) were reported at dosages of 20 mg/day in the controlled clinical trials: The following events were reported in Sjogren's patients at incidences of 1% to 2% at dosing of 20 mg/day: accidental injury allergic reaction back pain blurred vision constipation increased cough edema epistaxis face edema fever flatulence glossitis lab test abnormalities including chemistry hematology and urinalysis myalgia palpitation pruritus somnolence stomatitis tachycardia tinnitus urinary incontinence urinary tract infection vaginitis.

a6ceb47b-d0b0-d377-e053-2995a90a463e,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The following reactions have been reported during treatment with metronidazole: Central Nervous System: The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with metronidazole have been convulsive seizures encephalopathy aseptic meningitis optic and peripheral neuropathy the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole patients should be specifically warned about these reactions and should be told to stop the drug and report immediately to their physicians if any neurologic symptoms occur. In addition patients have reported headache syncope dizziness vertigo incoordination ataxia confusion dysarthria irritability de-pression weakness and insomnia (see WARNINGS ). Gastrointestinal: The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract particularly nausea sometimes accompanied by headache anorexia and occasionally vomiting> diarrhea> epigastric distress> and abdominal cramping and constipation. Mouth: A sharp unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue glossitis and stomatitis have occurred> these may be associated with a sudden overgrowth of Candida which may occur during therapy. Dermatologic: Erythematous rash and pruritus. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia)> rarely reversible thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular: Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Hypersensitivity: Urticaria erythematous rash Stevens-Johnson Syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis flushing nasal congestion dryness of the mouth (or vagina or vulva) and fever. Renal: Dysuria cystitis polyuria incontinence and a sense of pelvic pressure. Instances of darkened urine have been reported by approximately one patient in 100000. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance. Other: Proliferation of Candida in the vagina dyspareunia decrease of libido proctitis and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling ""serum sickness."" Rare cases of pancreatitis which generally abated on withdrawal of the drug have been reported. Patients with Crohn's disease are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers. There have been some reports in the medical literature of breast and colon cancer in Crohn's disease patients who have been treated with metronidazole at high doses for extended periods of time. A cause and effect relationship has not been established.

d43718e5-66d7-44f9-9fc8-80d38d3e41ce,ADVERSE REACTIONS Note: Some adverse effects of chlorpromazine may be more likely to occur or occur with greater intensity in patients with special medical problems e.g. patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses. Drowsiness: Usually mild to moderate may occur particularly during the first or second week after which it generally disappears. If troublesome dosage may be lowered. Jaundice: Overall incidence has been low regardless of indication or dosage. Most investigators conclude it is a sensitivity reaction. Most cases occur between the second and fourth weeks of therapy. The clinical picture resembles infectious hepatitis with laboratory features of obstructive jaundice rather than those of parenchymal damage. It is usually promptly reversible on withdrawal of the medication> however chronic jaundice has been reported. There is no conclusive evidence that pre-existing liver disease makes patients more susceptible to jaundice. Alcoholics with cirrhosis have been successfully treated with chlorpromazine without complications. Nevertheless the medication should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. Patients who have experienced jaundice with a phenothiazine should not if possible be reexposed to chlorpromazine or other phenothiazines. If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs appropriate liver studies should be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality stop treatment. Liver function tests in jaundice induced by the drug may mimic extrahepatic obstruction> withhold exploratory laparotomy until extrahepatic obstruction is confirmed. Hematological Disorders: including agranulocytosis eosinophilia leukopenia hemolytic anemia aplastic anemia thrombocytopenic purpura and pancytopenia have been reported. Agranulocytosis - Warn patients to report the sudden appearance of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential counts indicate cellular depression stop treatment and start antibiotic and other suitable therapy. Most cases have occurred between the fourth and tenth weeks of therapy> patients should be watched closely during that period. Moderate suppression of white blood cells is not an indication for stopping treatment unless accompanied by the symptoms described above. Cardiovascular: Hypotensive Effects - Postural hypotension simple tachycardia momentary fainting and dizziness may occur rarely after the first oral dose. Usually recovery is spontaneous and symptoms disappear within xbd to 2 hours. Occasionally these effects may be more severe and prolonged producing a shock-like condition. To control hypotension place patient in head-low position with legs raised. If a vasoconstrictor is required norepinephrine and phenylephrine are the most suitable. Other pressor agents including epinephrine should not be used as they may cause a paradoxical further lowering of blood pressure. EKG Changes - particularly nonspecific usually reversible Q and T wave distortions - have been observed in some patients receiving phenothiazine tranquilizers including chlorpromazine. Note: Sudden death apparently due to cardiac arrest has been reported. CNS Reactions: Extrapyramidal Symptoms - Neuromuscular reactions include dystonias motor restlessness pseudo-parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia and appear to be dose-related. They are discussed in the following paragraphs: Dystonia: Class effect: Symptoms of dystonia prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat swallowing difficulty difficulty breathing and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Motor Restlessness: Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided. If these symptoms become too troublesome they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti-parkinsonian agents benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful. Pseudo - parkinsonism: Symptoms may include: mask-like facies drooling tremors pillrolling motion cogwheel rigidity and shuffling gait. In most cases these symptoms are readily controlled when an anti-parkinsonism agent is administered concomitantly. Anti-parkinsonism agents should be used only when required. Generally therapy of a few weeks to 2 or 3 months will suffice. After this time patients should be evaluated to determine their need for continued treatment. ( Note: Levodopa has not been found effective in antipsychotic-induced pseudo-parkinsonism.) Occasionally it is necessary to lower the dosage of chlorpromazine or to discontinue the drug. Tardive Dyskinesia: As with all antipsychotic agents tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop although much less frequently after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients especially elderly women it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue face mouth or jaw (e.g. protrusion of tongue puffing of cheeks puckering of mouth chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia tardive dystonia has also been described. There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia> anti-parkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. If clinically feasible it is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment or increase the dosage of the agent or switch to a different antipsychotic agent the syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. Adverse Behavioral Effects - Psychotic symptoms and catatonic-like states have been reported rarely. Other CNS Effects - Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see WARNINGS ). Cerebral edema has been reported. Convulsive seizures (petit mal and grand mal) have been reported particularly in patients with EEG abnormalities or history of such disorders. Abnormality of the cerebrospinal fluid proteins has also been reported. Allergic Reactions of a mild urticarial type of photosensitivity are seen. Avoid undue exposure to sun. More severe reactions including exfoliative dermatitis have been reported occasionally. Contact dermatitis has been reported in nursing personnel> accordingly the use of rubber gloves when administering chlorpromazine liquid or injectable is recommended. In addition asthma laryngeal edema angioneurotic edema and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Endocrine Disorders: Lactation and moderate breast engorgement may occur in females on large doses. If persistent lower dosage or withdraw drug. False-positive pregnancy tests have been reported but are less likely to occur when a serum test is used. Amenorrhea and gynecomastia have also been reported. Hyperglycemia hypoglycemia and glycosuria have been reported. Autonomic Reactions: Occasional dry mouth> nasal congestion> nausea> obstipation> constipation> adynamic ileus> urinary retention priapism> miosis and mydriasis atonic colon ejaculatory disorders/impotence. Special Considerations in Long-Term Therapy: Skin pigmentation and ocular changes have occurred in some patients taking substantial doses of chlorpromazine for prolonged periods. Skin Pigmentation - Rare instances of skin pigmentation have been observed in hospitalized mental patients primarily females who have received the drug usually for 3 years or more in dosages ranging from 500 mg to 1500 mg daily. The pigmentary changes restricted to exposed areas of the body range from an almost imperceptible darkening of the skin to a slate gray color sometimes with a violet hue. Histological examination reveals a pigment chiefly in the dermis which is probably a melanin-like complex. This pigmentation may fade following discontinuance of the drug. Ocular Changes - Ocular changes have occurred more frequently than skin pigmentation and have been observed both in pigmented and nonpigmented patients receiving chlorpromazine usually for 2 years or more in dosages of 300 mg daily and higher. Eye changes are characterized by deposition of fine particulate matter in the lens and cornea. In more advanced cases star-shaped opacities have also been observed in the anterior portion of the lens. The nature of the eye deposits has not yet been determined. A small number of patients with more severe ocular changes have had some visual impairment. In addition to these corneal and lenticular changes epithelial keratopathy and pigmentary retinopathy have been reported. Reports suggest that the eye lesions may regress after withdrawal of the drug. Since the occurrence of eye changes seems to be related to dosage levels and/or duration of therapy it is suggested that long-term patients on moderate to high dosage levels have periodic ocular examinations. Etiology - Etiology of both of these reactions is not clear but exposure to light along with dosage/duration of therapy appears to be the most significant factor. If either of these reactions is observed the physician should weigh the benefits of continued therapy against the possible risks and on the merits of the individual case determine whether or not to continue present therapy lower the dosage or withdraw the drug. Other Adverse Reactions: Mild fever may occur after large I.M. doses. Hyperpyrexia has been reported. Increases in appetite and weight sometimes occur. Peripheral edema and a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome have been reported. Note: There have been occasional reports of sudden death in patients receiving phenothiazines.

11da2692-fb0a-4519-b8a4-323c7a6eeb4d,ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients were dizziness somnolence and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness somnolence and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Other events in more than 1% of patients but equally or more frequent in the placebo group included pain tremor neuralgia back pain dyspepsia dyspnea and flu syndrome. There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients >> 12 years of age not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients were somnolence dizziness ataxia fatigue and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients were viral infection fever nausea and/or vomiting somnolence and hostility (see WARNINGS Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients >> 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients >> 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%) ataxia (0.8%) fatigue (0.6%) nausea and/or vomiting (0.6%) and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%) hostility (1.3%) and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients >> 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies however does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Other events in more than 1% of patients >>12 years of age but equally or more frequent in the placebo group included: headache viral infection fever nausea and/or vomiting abdominal pain diarrhea convulsions confusion insomnia emotional lability rash acne. Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other) there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Other events in more than 2% of pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age but equally or more frequent in the placebo group included: pharyngitis upper respiratory infection headache rhinitis convulsions diarrhea anorexia coughing and otitis media. Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients >> 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain) only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients >> 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

5ce5ebd2-f1b5-4c04-a7de-56a1b7eb8197,ADVERSE REACTIONS The occurrence and severity of adverse reactions are generally directly related to serum lithium concentrations and to individual patient sensitivity to lithium. They generally occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher concentrations. Adverse reactions may be encountered at serum lithium concentrations below 1.5 mEq/L. Mild to moderate adverse reactions may occur at concentrations from 1.5 to 2.5 mEq/L and moderate to severe reactions may be seen at concentrations from 2 mEq/L and above. Fine hand tremor polyuria and mild thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Transient and mild nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These side effects usually subside with continued treatment or with a temporary reduction or cessation of dosage. If persistent a cessation of lithium therapy may be required. Diarrhea vomiting drowsiness muscular weakness and lack of coordination may be early signs of lithium intoxication and can occur at lithium concentrations below 2 mEq/L. At higher concentrations giddiness ataxia blurred vision tinnitus and a large output of dilute urine may be seen. Serum lithium concentrations above 3 mEq/L may produce a complex clinical picture involving multiple organs and organ systems. Serum lithium concentrations should not be permitted to exceed 2 mEq/L during the acute treatment phase. The following reactions have been reported and appear to be related to serum lithium concentrations including concentrations within the therapeutic range: Central Nervous System : tremor muscle hyperirritability (fasciculations twitching clonic movements of whole limbs) hypertonicity ataxia choreoathetotic movements hyperactive deep tendon reflex extrapyramidal symptoms including acute dystonia cogwheel rigidity blackout spells epileptiform seizures slurred speech dizziness vertigo downbeat nystagmus incontinence of urine or feces somnolence psychomotor retardation restlessness confusion stupor coma tongue movements tics tinnitus hallucinations poor memory slowed intellectual functioning startled response worsening of organic brain syndromes. Cardiovascular : cardiac arrhythmia hypotension peripheral circulatory collapse bradycardia sinus node dysfunction and severe bradycardia (which may result in syncope) Unmasking of Brugada Syndrome [See WARNINGS and PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION ]. Gastrointestinal : anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea gastritis salivary gland swelling abdominal pain excessive salivation flatulence indigestion. Genitourinary : glycosuria decreased creatinine clearance albuminuria oliguria and symptoms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus including polyuria thirst and polydipsia. Dermatologic : drying and thinning of hair alopecia anesthesia of skin acne chronic folliculitis xerosis cutis psoriasis or its exacerbation generalized pruritus with or without rash cutaneous ulcers angioedema. Autonomic Nervous System : blurred vision dry mouth impotence/sexual dysfunction. Thyroid Abnormalities : euthyroid goiter and/or hypothyroidism (including myxedema) accompanied by lower T 3 and T 4 . 131 Iodine uptake may be elevated (see PRECAUTIONS ). Paradoxically rare cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported. EEG Changes : diffuse slowing widening of frequency spectrum potentiation and disorganization of background rhythm. EKG Changes : reversible flattening isoelectricity or inversion of T-waves. Miscellaneous : fatigue lethargy transient scotomata exophthalmos dehydration weight loss leukocytosis headache transient-hyperglycemia hypercalcemia hyperparathyroidism albuminuria excessive weight gain edematous swelling of ankles or wrists metallic taste dysgeusia/taste distortion salty taste thirst swollen lips tightness in chest swollen and/or painful joints fever polyarthralgia and dental caries. Some reports of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus hyperparathyroidism and hypothyroidism which persist after lithium discontinuation have been received. A few reports have been received of the development of painful discoloration of fingers and toes and coldness of the extremities within one day of starting lithium treatment.

8be91604-d7cd-4f2b-997d-e3364e4092e5,"ADVERSE REACTIONS Gastrointestinal Heartburn epigastric distress anorexia nausea vomiting jaundice flatulence cramps and diarrhea have been noted in some patients. Although Clostridium difficile has been shown in vitro to be sensitive to rifampin pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with the use of rifampin (and other broad-spectrum antibiotics). Therefore it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who develop diarrhea in association with antibiotic use. Tooth discoloration (which may be permanent) may occur. Hepatic Hepatotoxicity including transient abnormalities in liver function tests (e.g. elevations in serum bilirubin alkaline phosphatase serum transaminases gamma-glutamyl transferase) hepatitis a shock-like syndrome with hepatic involvement and abnormal liver function tests and cholestasis have been reported (see WARNINGS ). Hematologic Thrombocytopenia has occurred primarily with high dose intermittent therapy but has also been noted after resumption of interrupted treatment. It rarely occurs during well-supervised daily therapy. This effect is reversible if the drug is discontinued as soon as purpura occurs. Cerebral hemorrhage and fatalities have been reported when rifampin administration has been continued or resumed after the appearance of purpura. Rare reports of disseminated intravascular coagulation have been observed. Leukopenia hemolytic anemia decreased hemoglobin bleeding and vitamin K-dependent coagulation disorders (abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time or low vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors) have been observed. Agranulocytosis has been reported very rarely. Central Nervous System Headache fever drowsiness fatigue ataxia dizziness inability to concentrate mental confusion behavioral changes muscular weakness pains in extremities and generalized numbness have been observed. Psychoses have been rarely reported. Rare reports of myopathy have also been observed. Ocular Visual disturbances have been observed. Endocrine Menstrual disturbances have been observed. Rare reports of adrenal insufficiency in patients with compromised adrenal function have been observed. Renal Elevations in BUN and serum uric acid have been reported. Rarely hemolysis hemoglobinuria hematuria interstitial nephritis acute tubular necrosis renal insufficiency and acute renal failure have been noted. These are generally considered to be hypersensitivity reactions. They usually occur during intermittent therapy or when treatment is resumed following intentional or accidental interruption of a daily dosage regimen and are reversible when rifampin is discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Dermatologic Cutaneous reactions are mild and self-limiting and do not appear to be hypersensitivity reactions. Typically they consist of flushing and itching with or without a rash. More serious cutaneous reactions which may be due to hypersensitivity occur but are uncommon. Hypersensitivity Reactions Occasionally pruritus urticaria rash pemphigoid reaction erythema multiforme acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Stevens-Johnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms syndrome (see WARNINGS ) vasculitis eosinophilia sore mouth sore tongue and conjunctivitis have been observed. Anaphylaxis has been reported rarely. Miscellaneous Edema of the face and extremities has been reported. Other reactions which have occurred with intermittent dosage regimens include ""flu syndrome"" (such as episodes of fever chills headache dizziness and bone pain) shortness of breath wheezing decrease in blood pressure and shock. The ""flu syndrome"" may also appear if rifampin is taken irregularly by the patient or if daily administration is resumed after a drug-free interval.","gastrointestinal heartburn, epigastric distress, anorexia nausea vomiting jaundice flatulence cramps diarrhea,  clostridium difficile, sensitive, rifampin, pseudomembranous colitis, rifampin, broad-spectrum antibiotics, diagnosis, diarrhea, association, antibiotic, tooth discoloration, permanent, hepatic, hepatotoxicity, transient abnormalities, liver function tests, elevations, serum bilirubin alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase hepatitis shock-like syndrome, hepatic, involvement, abnormal, liver function, cholestasis, hematologic thrombocytopenia, therapy, resumption, treatment, well-supervised daily therapy, effect, drug discontinued, purpura, cerebral hemorrhage, fatalities, rifampin, administration, appearance, purpura, reports, disseminated, intravascular coagulation, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, hemoglobin bleeding, vitamin k-dependent coagulation disorders, abnormal, prolongation, prothrombin time, low, vitamin k-dependent coagulation factors, agranulocytosis, rarely, central nervous system, headache fever, drowsiness fatigue ataxia dizziness, concentrate, mental confusion, behavioral, muscular weakness, pains extremities, generalized numbness, psychoses, reports, myopathy, ocular, visual disturbances, endocrine, observed, reports, adrenal insufficiency, adrenal function, renal elevations, serum, uric acid, hemolysis hemoglobinuria hematuria, interstitial nephritis, acute, acute renal failure, hypersensitivity reactions, intermittent, therapy, treatment, intentional, accidental, interruption, daily, dosage regimen, rifampin, discontinued, therapy, dermatologic cutaneous, hypersensitivity reactions, flushing itching, rash, cutaneous, hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity, pruritus urticaria rash, pemphigoid reaction erythema, acute, stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic, epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction, eosinophilia, systemic symptoms syndrome, vasculitis eosinophilia, sore mouth sore tongue conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis, miscellaneous edema, intermittent, dosage regimens, flu syndrome, episodes, fever chills headache, dizziness bone pain, shortness breath wheezing, decrease, blood pressure shock, flu syndrome, rifampin, patient, administration, drug-free interval"
8ec2d256-fc4f-44f6-bee2-eef2bf3bf580,ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic Adverse experiences following the administration of lidocaine HCl are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are in general dose- related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection or may result from a hypersensitivity idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: Central Nervous System CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness nervousness apprehension euphoria confusion dizziness drowsiness tinnitus blurred or double vision vomiting sensations of heat cold or numbness twitching tremors convulsions unconsciousness respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Drowsiness following the administration of lidocaine HCl is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular System Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia hypotension and cardiovascular collapse which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions urticaria edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in the multiple dose vials. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions may occur as result of sensitivity to lidocaine but are infrequent. If allergic reactions do occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. There have been no reports of cross sensitivity between lidocaine hydrochloride and procainamide or between lidocaine hydrochloride and quinidine. Neurologic The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10440 patients who received lidocaine HCl for spinal anesthesia the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional headaches hypotension and backache> 2 percent for shivering> and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms nausea respiratory inadequacy and double vision. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic. In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block) hypotension secondary to spinal block loss of bladder and bowel control and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures. There have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration.

The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Gastrointestinal: anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea glossitis dysphagia enterocolitis and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis Stevens-Johnson syndrome erythema multiforme maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above. (See WARNINGS ). Renal toxicity: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related. (See WARNINGS ).

The most frequently reported reactions are local irritation stinging and burning. Less commonly reported reactions include non-specific conjunctivitis conjunctival hyperemia secondary infections and allergic reactions.

b488c106-f1ee-4b7b-8516-01162fb929f7,"ADVERSE REACTIONS CNS Effects Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) EPS during the administration of haloperidol have been reported frequently often during the first few days of treatment. EPS can be categorized generally as Parkinson-like symptoms akathisia or dystonia (including opisthotonos and oculogyric crisis). While all can occur at relatively low doses they occur more frequently and with greater severity at higher doses. The symptoms may be controlled with dose reductions or administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate USP or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride USP. It should be noted that persistent EPS have been reported> the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs Generally patients receiving short term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under ""Tardive Dyskinesia"" except for duration. It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs but until further evidence becomes available it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents haloperidol has been associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive dyskinesia a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible involuntary dyskinetic movements may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on high-dose therapy especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue face mouth or jaw (e.g. protrusion of tongue puffing of cheeks puckering of mouth chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk. There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia> antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment or increase the dosage of the agent or switch to a different antipsychotic agent this syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and if the medication is stopped at that time the full syndrome may not develop. Tardive Dystonia Tardive dystonia not associated with the above syndrome has also been reported. Tardive dystonia is characterized by delayed onset of choreic or dystonic movements is often persistent and has the potential of becoming irreversible. Dystonia Class effect Symptoms of dystonia prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat swallowing difficulty difficulty breathing and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Other CNS Effects Insomnia restlessness anxiety euphoria agitation drowsiness depression lethargy headache confusion vertigo grand mal seizures exacerbation of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations and catatonic-like behavioral states which may be responsive to drug withdrawal and/or treatment with anticholinergic drugs. Body as a Whole Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) hyperpyrexia and heat stroke have been reported with haloperidol (see WARNINGS for further information concerning NMS). Cardiovascular Effects Tachycardia hypotension hypertension and ECG changes including prolongation of the Q-T interval and ECG pattern changes compatible with the polymorphous configuration of torsade de pointes. Hematologic Effects Reports have appeared citing the occurrence of mild and usually transient leukopenia and leukocytosis minimal decreases in red blood cell counts anemia or a tendency toward lymphomonocytosis. Agranulocytosis has rarely been reported to have occurred with the use of haloperidol and then only in association with other medication. Liver Effects Impaired liver function and/or jaundice have been reported. Dermatologic Reactions Maculopapular and acneiform skin reactions and isolated cases of photosensitivity and loss of hair. Endocrine Disorders Lactation breast engorgement mastalgia menstrual irregularities gynecomastia impotence increased libido hyperglycemia hypoglycemia and hyponatremia. Gastrointestinal Effects Anorexia constipation diarrhea hypersalivation dyspepsia nausea and vomiting. Autonomic Reactions Dry mouth blurred vision urinary retention diaphoresis and priapism. Respiratory Effects Laryngospasm bronchospasm and increased depth of respiration. Special Senses Cataracts retinopathy and visual disturbances. Other Cases of sudden and unexpected death have been reported in association with the administration of haloperidol. The nature of the evidence makes it impossible to determine definitively what role if any haloperidol played in the outcome of the reported cases. The possibility that haloperidol caused death cannot of course be excluded but it is to be kept in mind that sudden and unexpected death may occur in psychotic patients when they go untreated or when they are treated with other antipsychotic drugs.

Cardiac In acromegalics sinus bradycardia (<> 50 bpm) developed in 25%> conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias developed in 9% of patients during octreotide acetate therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). Gastrointestinal Diarrhea loose stools nausea and abdominal discomfort were each seen in 34% to 61% of acromegalic patients in U.S. studies although only 2.6% of the patients discontinued therapy due to these symptoms. These symptoms were seen in 5%-10% of patients with other disorders. The frequency of these symptoms was not dose-related but diarrhea and abdominal discomfort generally resolved more quickly in patients treated with 300 mcg/day than in those treated with 750 mcg/day. Vomiting flatulence abnormal stools abdominal distention and constipation were each seen in less than 10% of patients. In rare instances gastrointestinal side effects may resemble acute intestinal obstruction with progressive abdominal distension severe epigastric pain abdominal tenderness and guarding. Hypo/Hyperglycemia Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occurred in 3% and 16% of acromegalic patients respectively but only in about 1.5% of other patients. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were noted in approximately 2% of patients. Hypothyroidism In acromegalics biochemical hypothyroidism alone occurred in 12% while goiter occurred in 6% during octreotide acetate therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: General ). In patients without acromegaly hypothyroidism has only been reported in several isolated patients and goiter has not been reported. Other Adverse Events Pain on injection was reported in 7.7% headache in 6% and dizziness in 5%. Pancreatitis was also observed (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ).

Evaluation of 20 patients treated for at least 6 months has failed to demonstrate titers of antibodies exceeding background levels. However antibody titers to octreotide acetate were subsequently reported in three patients and resulted in prolonged duration of drug action in two patients. Anaphylactoid reactions including anaphylactic shock have been reported in several patients receiving octreotide acetate. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postapproval use of octreotide acetate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

f99ebf66-f207-4a97-9666-4da1d72b061c,ADVERSE REACTIONS No side effects or manifestations not seen with either compound alone have been reported with the administration of Librax. However since Librax contains chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide the possibility of untoward effects which may be seen with either of these two compounds cannot be excluded. When chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride has been used alone the necessity of discontinuing therapy because of undesirable effects has been rare. Drowsiness ataxia and confusion have been reported in some patients - particularly the elderly and debilitated. While these effects can be avoided in almost all instances by proper dosage adjustment they have occasionally been observed at the lower dosage ranges. In a few instances syncope has been reported. Other adverse reactions reported during therapy with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride include isolated instances of skin eruptions edema minor menstrual irregularities nausea and constipation extrapyramidal symptoms as well as increased and decreased libido. Such side effects have been infrequent and are generally controlled with reduction of dosage. Changes in EEG patterns (low-voltage fast activity) have been observed in patients during and after chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride treatment. Blood dyscrasias including agranulocytosis jaundice and hepatic dysfunction have occasionally been reported during therapy with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride. When chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride treatment is protracted periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable. Adverse effects reported with use of Librax are those typical of anticholinergic agents i.e. dryness of the mouth blurring of vision urinary hesitancy and constipation. Constipation has occurred most often when Librax therapy has been combined with other spasmolytic agents and/or a low residue diet.,"side effects, manifestations, compound, administration, librax, chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, clidinium bromide, compounds, chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, discontinuing, therapy, drowsiness ataxia, confusion, elderly, effects, dosage, lower, dosage, syncope, therapy, chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, isolated, skin eruptions edema, minor, nausea constipation, extrapyramidal, symptoms, libido, side effects, infrequent, reduction, dosage, eeg patterns, low-voltage fast activity, chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, treatment, blood dyscrasias, agranulocytosis jaundice hepatic dysfunction, therapy, chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride, treatment, protracted, periodic blood counts, liver function, librax, anticholinergic agents, dryness mouth, blurring, vision, urinary hesitancy constipation, constipation, librax therapy, spasmolytic agents, low residue diet"

82b377ee-0e3e-4cb9-a644-f45434c21cca,ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic Adverse experiences following the administration of lidocaine HCl are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are in general dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection or may result from a hypersensitivity idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: Central Nervous System CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness nervousness apprehension euphoria confusion dizziness drowsiness tinnitus blurred or double vision vomiting sensations of heat cold or numbness twitching tremors convulsions unconsciousness respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Drowsiness following the administration of lidocaine HCl is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular System Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia hypotension and cardiovascular collapse which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions urticaria edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in the multiple dose vials. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine but are infrequent. If allergic reactions do occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. There have been no reports of cross sensitivity between lidocaine hydrochloride and procainamide or between lidocaine hydrochloride and quinidine. Neurologic The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10440 patients who received lidocaine HCl for spinal anesthesia the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional headaches hypotension and backache> 2 percent for shivering> and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms nausea respiratory inadequacy and double vision. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic. In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block) hypotension secondary to spinal block loss of bladder and bowel control and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures. There have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration.

Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : Angioedema involving the extremities face lips mucous membranes tongue glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused fatal airway obstruction (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Cough : Cough has been reported in 0.5 to 2% of patients treated with captopril in clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: General Cough ). The following have been reported in about 0.5 to 2 percent of patients but did not appear at increased frequency compared to placebo or other treatments used in controlled trials: gastric irritation abdominal pain nausea vomiting diarrhea anorexia constipation aphthous ulcers peptic ulcer dizziness headache malaise fatigue insomnia dry mouth dyspnea alopecia paresthesias. Other clinical adverse effects reported since the drug was marketed are listed below by body system. In this setting an incidence or causal relationship cannot be accurately determined.

d428aa4d-4cc0-4b1e-b9f6-40ae65a735d6,ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with nifedipine extended-release tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during nifedipine extended-release tablets therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with nifedipine extended-release tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Of these only edema and headache were more common in nifedipine extended-release tablets patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3.0%. With the exception of leg cramps the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia flushing pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia nervousness paresthesia somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain diarrhea dry mouth dyspepsia flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific) dyspnea Urogenital: impotence polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1.0% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema fever hot flashes malaise periorbital edema rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia hypotension increased angina tachycardia syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety ataxia decreased libido depression hypertonia hypoesthesia migraine paroniria tremor vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia increased sweating urticaria purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation gastroesophageal reflux gum hyperplasia melena vomiting weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain gout myalgias Respiratory: coughing epistaxis upper respiratory tract infection respiratory disorder sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation abnormal vision taste perversion tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain dysuria hematuria nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences reported in less than 1% of patients occurred under conditions (e.g. open trials marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation gastrointestinal bleeding gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery including the need for bezoar removal has occurred in association with nifedipine extended-release tablets even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease. (See WARNINGS ) Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with nifedipine extended-release tablets. In addition more serious adverse events were observed not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible however that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine-treated patients. (See PRECAUTIONS ) In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina dizziness or lightheadedness peripheral edema headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions.

268afeca-a67f-4ec4-8893-2046245257cc,Adverse Reactions As with other drugs of this class the administration of Sedivet 1.0% Injection causes bradycardia (possibly profound) first and second degree atrioventricular heart block and hypotension. The frequency and duration of cardiac arrhythmias have been shown to be dose related. The following commonly occurring adverse reactions have been noted using u03b1 2 -agonists: hypertension hypotension bradycardia ataxia piloerection sweating muscle tremors salivation penile relaxation urination (about an hour after treatment) lowering of head (causing passive congestion and swelling of face lips upper airways) stridor decreased gastrointestinal motility flatulence and mild colic.

3d1c4b4d-18e2-4e8f-9701-badaa462c733,"ADVERSE REACTIONS As with other penicillins it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena. They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillins and in those with a history of allergy asthma hay fever or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin: Gastrointestinal Glossitis stomatitis black ""hairy"" tongue nausea vomiting enterocolitis pseudomembranous colitis and diarrhea. (These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms.) Hypersensitivity Reactions Skin rashes and urticaria have been reported frequently. A few cases of exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme have been reported. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form. Note: Urticaria other skin rashes and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and if necessary systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur ampicillin should be discontinued unless in the opinion of the physician the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactic reactions require the immediate use of epinephrine oxygen and intravenous steroids. Liver - A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) has been noted particularly in infants but the significance of this finding is unknown. Mild transitory SGOT elevations have been observed in individuals receiving larger (two to four times) than usual and oft-repeated intramuscular injections. Evidence indicates that glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is released at the site of intramuscular injection of ampicillin sodium and that the presence of increased amounts of this enzyme in the blood does not necessarily indicate liver involvement. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems - Anemia thrombocytopenia thrombocytopenic purpura eosinophilia leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with the penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.

8e41e42c-3ae0-4091-970b-bc0086755f1d,"ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Itraconazole Oral Solution has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of Itraconazole Oral Solution use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients .) Adverse Events Reported in Oropharyngeal or Esophageal Candidiasis Trials U.S. adverse experience data are derived from 350 immunocompromised patients (332 HIV seropositive/AIDS) treated for oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis. Table 3 below lists adverse events reported by at least 2% of patients treated with Itraconazole Oral Solution Oral Solution in U.S. clinical trials. Data on patients receiving comparator agents in these trials are included for comparison. Adverse events reported by less than 2% of patients in U.S. clinical trials with Itraconazole Oral Solution included: adrenal insufficiency asthenia back pain dehydration dyspepsia dysphagia flatulence gynecomastia hematuria hemorrhoids hot flushes implantation complication infection unspecified injury insomnia male breast pain myalgia pharyngitis pruritus rhinitis rigors stomatitis ulcerative taste perversion tinnitus upper respiratory tract infection vision abnormal and weight decrease.

Post-marketing Experience Adverse drug reactions that have been first identified during post-marketing experience with Itraconazole Oral Solution (all formulations) are listed in Table 4 below. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible. There is limited information on the use of Itraconazole Oral Solution during pregnancy. Cases of congenital abnormalities including skeletal genitourinary tract cardiovascular and ophthalmic malformations as well as chromosomal and multiple malformations have been reported during post-marketing experience.

6add8355-2ad8-422e-1289-027aecbc3b62,ADVERSE REACTIONS See WARNINGS concerning serious cardiorespiratory events and possible paradoxical reactions. Fluctuations in vital signs were the most frequently seen findings following parenteral administration of midazolam in adults and included decreased tidal volume and/or respiratory rate decrease (23.3% of patients following intravenous and 10.8% of patients following intramuscular administration) and apnea (15.4% of patients following intravenous administration) as well as variations in blood pressure and pulse rate. The majority of serious adverse effects particularly those associated with oxygenation and ventilation have been reported when midazolam is administered with other medications capable of depressing the central nervous system. The incidence of such events is higher in patients undergoing procedures involving the airway without the protective effect of an endotracheal tube (e.g. upper endoscopy and dental procedures). Adults The following additional adverse reactions were reported after intramuscular administration: Administration of intramuscular midazolam to elderly and/or higher risk surgical patients has been associated with rare reports of death under circumstances compatible with cardiorespiratory depression. In most of these cases the patients also received other central nervous system depressants capable of depressing respiration especially narcotics (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The following additional adverse reactions were reported subsequent to intravenous administration as a single sedative/anxiolytic/amnestic agent in adult patients: Pediatric Patients The following adverse events related to the use of intravenous midazolam in pediatric patients were reported in the medical literature: desaturation 4.6% apnea 2.8% hypotension 2.7% paradoxical reactions 2.0% hiccough 1.2 % seizure-like activity 1.1% and nystagmus 1.1%.

cd7b7c4d-8dd1-4a0a-a506-a84407816bdf,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse experiences for clonazepam are provided separately for patients with seizure disorders and with panic disorder. Seizure Disorders The most frequently occurring side effects of clonazepam are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases these may diminish with time> behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Others listed by system including those identified during postapproval use of clonazepam are: Cardiovascular: Palpitations Dermatologic: Hair loss hirsutism skin rash ankle and facial edema Gastrointestinal: Anorexia coated tongue constipation diarrhea dry mouth encopresis gastritis increased appetite nausea sore gums Genitourinary: Dysuria enuresis nocturia urinary retention Hematopoietic: Anemia leukopenia thrombocytopenia eosinophilia Hepatic: Hepatomegaly transient elevations of serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness pains Miscellaneous: Dehydration general deterioration fever lymphadenopathy weight loss or gain Neurologic: Abnormal eye movements aphonia choreiform movements coma diplopia dysarthria dysdiadochokinesis ""glassy-eyed"" appearance headache hemiparesis hypotonia nystagmus respiratory depression slurred speech tremor vertigo Psychiatric: Confusion depression amnesia hysteria increased libido insomnia psychosis (the behavior effects are more likely to occur in patients with a history of psychiatric disturbances). The following paradoxical reactions have been observed: irritability aggression agitation nervousness hostility anxiety sleep disturbances nightmares abnormal dreams and hallucinations. Respiratory: Chest congestion rhinorrhea shortness of breath hypersecretion in upper respiratory passages Panic Disorder Adverse events during exposure to clonazepam were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow CIGY dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events except in certain cases in which redundant terms were collapsed into more meaningful terms as noted below. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Overall the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17% in clonazepam compared to 9% for placebo in the combined data of two 6 to 9 week trials. The most common events (> 1%) associated with discontinuation and a dropout rate twice or greater for clonazepam than that of placebo included the following: Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More among Clonazepam-Treated Patients Table 3 enumerates the incidence rounded to the nearest percent of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during acute therapy of panic disorder from a pool of two 6 to 9 week trials. Events reported in 1% or more of patients treated with clonazepam (doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/day) and for which the incidence was greater than that in placebo-treated patients are included. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in Table 3 cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events Treatment-Emergent Depressive Symptoms In the pool of two short-term placebo-controlled trials adverse events classified under the preferred term ""depression"" were reported in 7% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients without any clear pattern of dose relatedness. In these same trials adverse events classified under the preferred term ""depression"" were reported as leading to discontinuation in 4% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. While these findings are noteworthy Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression. Other Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Clonazepam in Panic Disorder Following is a list of modified CIGY terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with clonazepam at multiple doses during clinical trials. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling those events for which a drug cause was remote those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. It is important to emphasize that although the events occurred during treatment with clonazepam they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency. These adverse events were reported infrequently which is defined as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients.

However hypotension and bradycardia have been observed. Arrhythmia has also occurred. Respiration Although respiration is frequently stimulated severe depression of respiration or apnea may occur following rapid intravenous administration of high doses of ketamine. Laryngospasms and other forms of airway obstruction have occurred during ketamine anesthesia. Eye Diplopia and nystagmus have been noted following ketamine administration. It also may cause a slight elevation in intraocular pressure measurement. Genitourinary In individuals with history of chronic ketamine use or abuse lower urinary tract and bladder symptoms including dysuria increased urinary frequency urgency urge incontinence and hematuria have been reported (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In addition diagnostic studies performed to assess the cause of these symptoms have reported cystitis (including cystitis non-infective cystitis interstitial cystitis ulcerative cystitis erosive and cystitis hemorrhagic) as well as hydronephrosis and reduced bladder capacity. Psychological (See SPECIAL NOTE .) Neurological In some patients enhanced skeletal muscle tone may be manifested by tonic and clonic movements sometimes resembling seizures (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

a107db4d-9fbe-32c0-388a-3f38341e8c97,ADVERSE REACTIONS Labetalol hydrochloride injection is usually well tolerated. Most adverse effects have been mild and transient and in controlled trials involving 92 patients did not require labetalol HCl withdrawal. Symptomatic postural hypotension (incidence 58%) is likely to occur if patients are tilted or allowed to assume the upright position within 3 hours of receiving labetalol hydrochloride injection. Moderate hypotension occurred in 1 of 100 patients while supine. Increased sweating was noted in 4 of 100 patients and flushing occurred in 1 of 100 patients. The following also were reported with labetalol hydrochloride injection with the incidence per 100 patients as noted: Cardiovascular System: Ventricular arrhythmia in 1. Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems: Dizziness in 9 tingling of the scalp/skin in 7 hypoesthesia (numbness) and vertigo in 1 each. Gastrointestinal System: Nausea in 13 vomiting in 4 dyspepsia and taste distortion in 1 each. Metabolic Disorders: Transient increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels occurred in 8 of 100 patients> these were associated with drops in blood pressure generally in patients with prior renal insufficiency. Psychiatric Disorders: Somnolence/yawning in 3. Respiratory System: Wheezing in 1. Skin: Pruritus in 1. The incidence of adverse reactions depends upon the dose of labetalol HCl. The largest experience is with oral labetalol HCl (see Labetalol Hydrochloride Tablets Product Information for details). Certain of the side effects increased with increasing oral dose as shown in the following table that depicts the entire US therapeutic trials data base for adverse reactions that are clearly or possibly dose related. In addition a number of other less common adverse events have been reported: Cardiovascular: Hypotension and rarely syncope bradycardia heart block. Liver and Biliary System: Hepatic necrosis hepatitis cholestatic jaundice elevated liver function tests. Hypersensitivity: Rare reports of hypersensitivity (e.g. rash urticaria pruritus angioedema dyspnea) and anaphylactoid reactions. The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the beta-blocker practolol has not been reported with labetalol HCl during investigational use and extensive foreign marketing experience.

da52596f-66be-4c5a-9f82-599d5e3db3cd,ADVERSE REACTIONS Associated With Discontinuation of Treatment Nineteen percent (537/2897) of venlafaxine patients in Phase 2 and Phase 3 depression studies discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The more common events (> 1%) associated with discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. those events associated with dropout at a rate approximately twice or greater for venlafaxine compared to placebo) included: Incidence in Controlled Trials Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Controlled Clinical Trials The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of venlafaxine hydrochloride (incidence of 5% or greater) and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients (i.e. incidence for venlafaxine hydrochloride at least twice that for placebo) derived from the 1% incidence table below were asthenia sweating nausea constipation anorexia vomiting somnolence dry mouth dizziness nervousness anxiety tremor and blurred vision as well as abnormal ejaculation/orgasm and impotence in men. Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Venlafaxine Hydrochloride-Treated Patients The table that follows enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more and were more frequent than in the placebo group among venlafaxine hydrochloride-treated patients who participated in short-term (4 to 8 week) placebo-controlled trials in which patients were administered doses in a range of 75 to 375 mg/day. This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least one episode of an event at some time during their treatment. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied. Dose Dependency of Adverse Events A comparison of adverse event rates in a fixed-dose study comparing venlafaxine hydrochloride 75 225 and 375 mg/day with placebo revealed a dose dependency for some of the more common adverse events associated with venlafaxine hydrochloride use as shown in the table that follows. The rule for including events was to enumerate those that occurred at an incidence of 5% or more for at least one of the venlafaxine groups and for which the incidence was at least twice the placebo incidence for at least one venlafaxine hydrochloride group. Tests for potential dose relationships for these events (Cochran-Armitage Test with a criterion of exact 2 sided p-value < 0.05) suggested a dose-dependency for several adverse events in this list including chills hypertension anorexia nausea agitation dizziness somnolence tremor yawning sweating and abnormal ejaculation. Adaptation to Certain Adverse Events Over a 6 week period there was evidence of adaptation to some adverse events with continued therapy (e.g. dizziness and nausea) but less to other effects (e.g. abnormal ejaculation and dry mouth). Vital Sign Changes Venlafaxine hydrochloride treatment (averaged over all dose groups) in clinical trials was associated with a mean increase in pulse rate of approximately 3 beats per minute compared to no change for placebo. In a flexible-dose study with doses in the range of 200 to 375 mg/day and mean dose greater than 300 mg/day the mean pulse was increased by about 2 beats per minute compared with a decrease of about 1 beat per minute for placebo. In controlled clinical trials venlafaxine hydrochloride was associated with mean increases in diastolic blood pressure ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 mm Hg averaged over all dose groups compared to mean decreases ranging from 0.9 to 3.8 mm Hg for placebo. However there is a dose dependency for blood pressure increase (see WARNINGS ). Laboratory Changes Of the serum chemistry and hematology parameters monitored during clinical trials with venlafaxine hydrochloride a statistically significant difference with placebo was seen only for serum cholesterol. In premarketing trials treatment with venlafaxine tablets was associated with a mean final on-therapy increase in total cholesterol of 3 mg/dL. Patients treated with venlafaxine tablets for at least 3 months in placebo-controlled 12 month extension trials had a mean final on-therapy increase in total cholesterol of 9.1 mg/dL compared with a decrease of 7.1 mg/dL among placebo-treated patients. This increase was duration dependent over the study period and tended to be greater with higher doses. Clinically relevant increases in serum cholesterol defined as 1) a final on-therapy increase in serum cholesterol > 50 mg/dL from baseline and to a value > 261 mg/dL or 2) an average on-therapy increase in serum cholesterol > 50 mg/dL from baseline and to a value > 261 mg/dL were recorded in 5.3% of venlafaxine-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients (see PRECAUTIONS General Serum Cholesterol Elevation ). ECG Changes In an analysis of ECGs obtained in 769 patients treated with venlafaxine hydrochloride and 450 patients treated with placebo in controlled clinical trials the only statistically significant difference observed was for heart rate i.e. a mean increase from baseline of 4 beats per minute for venlafaxine hydrochloride. In a flexible-dose study with doses in the range of 200 to 375 mg/day and mean dose greater than 300 mg/day the mean change in heart rate was 8.5 beats per minute compared with 1.7 beats per minute for placebo (see PRECAUTIONS General Use in Patients With Concomitant Illness ). Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Venlafaxine During its premarketing assessment multiple doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride were administered to 2897 patients in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. In addition in premarketing assessment of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules multiple doses were administered to 705 patients in Phase 3 major depressive disorder studies and venlafaxine hydrochloride was administered to 96 patients. During its premarketing assessment multiple doses of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules were also administered to 1381 patients in Phase 3 GAD studies and 277 patients in Phase 3 Social Anxiety Disorder studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to venlafaxine in both development programs varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies uncontrolled and controlled studies inpatient (venlafaxine hydrochloride only) and outpatient studies fixed-dose and titration studies. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented therefore represent the proportion of the 5356 patients exposed to multiple doses of either formulation of venlafaxine who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving venlafaxine. All reported events are included except those already listed in TABLE 2 and those events for which a drug cause was remote. If the COSTART term for an event was so general as to be uninformative it was replaced with a more informative term. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with venlafaxine they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.

baa6018f-34d4-4654-a0ba-70521fcb72cd,ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypoglycemia: See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE Sections. Gastrointestinal Reactions: Cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur rarely which may progress to liver failure> glyburide tablets should be discontinued if this occurs. Liver function abnormalities including isolated transaminase elevations have been reported. Gastrointestinal disturbances e.g. nausea epigastric fullness and heartburn are the most common reactions having occurred in 1.8% of treated patients during clinical trials. They tend to be dose related and may disappear when dosage is reduced. Dermatologic Reactions: Allergic skin reactions e.g. pruritus erythema urticaria and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions occurred in 1.5% of treated patients during clinical trials. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of glyburide> if skin reactions persist the drug should be discontinued. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic Reactions: Leukopenia agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia hemolytic anemia (see PRECAUTIONS ) aplastic anemia and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic Reactions: Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas> however hepatic porphyria has not been reported with glyburide and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported very rarely. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with glyburide and all other sulfonylureas most often in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion has been reported with certain other sulfonylureas and it has been suggested that these sulfonylureas may augment the peripheral (antidiuretic) action of ADH and/or increase release of ADH. Other Reactions: Changes in accommodation and/or blurred vision have been reported with glyburide and other sulfonylureas. These are thought to be related to fluctuation in glucose levels.

5de677d1-f3eb-4019-9e6f-b1f4209f7bb7,ADVERSE REACTIONS Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride In double-blind clinical trials involving glyburide and metformin hydrochloride as initial therapy or as second-line therapy a total of 642 patients received glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 312 received metformin therapy 324 received glyburide therapy and 161 received placebo. The percent of patients reporting events and types of adverse events reported in clinical trials of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (all strengths) as initial therapy and second-line therapy are listed in Table 6 . In a controlled clinical trial of rosiglitazone versus placebo in patients treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (n=365) 181 patients received glyburide and metformin hydrochloride with rosiglitazone and 184 received glyburide and metformin hydrochloride with placebo. Edema was reported in 7.7% (14/181) of patients treated with rosiglitazone compared to 2.2% (4/184) of patients treated with placebo. A mean weight gain of 3 kg was observed in rosiglitazone-treated patients. Disulfiram-like reactions have very rarely been reported in patients treated with glyburide tablets. Hypoglycemia In controlled clinical trials of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride there were no hypoglycemic episodes requiring medical intervention and/or pharmacologic therapy> all events were managed by the patients. The incidence of reported symptoms of hypoglycemia (such as dizziness shakiness sweating and hunger) in the initial therapy trial of glyburide and metformin hydrochloride are summarized in Table 7 . The frequency of hypoglycemic symptoms in patients treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 1.25 mg/250 mg was highest in patients with a baseline HbA 1c <>7% lower in those with a baseline HbA 1c of between 7% and 8% and was comparable to placebo and metformin in those with a baseline HbA 1c >>8%. For patients with a baseline HbA 1c between 8% and 11% treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride 2.5 mg/500 mg as initial therapy the frequency of hypoglycemic symptoms was 30% to 35%. As second-line therapy in patients inadequately controlled on sulfonylurea alone approximately 6.8% of all patients treated with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride experienced hypoglycemic symptoms. When rosiglitazone was added to glyburide and metformin hydrochloride therapy 22% of patients reported 1 or more fingerstick glucose measurements <50 mg/dL compared to 3.3% of placebo-treated patients. All hypoglycemic events were managed by the patients and only 1 patient discontinued for hypoglycemia. (See PRECAUTIONS: General: Addition of Thiazolidinediones to Glyburide and Metformin Hydrochloride Therapy. ) Gastrointestinal Reactions The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (diarrhea nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain) in the initial therapy trial are summarized in Table 7 . Across all glyburide and metformin hydrochloride trials GI symptoms were the most common adverse events with glyburide and metformin hydrochloride and were more frequent at higher dose levels. In controlled trials <>2% of patients discontinued glyburide and metformin hydrochloride therapy due to GI adverse events. Metformin Hydrochloride Cholestatic hepatocellular and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin. Glyburide Gastrointestinal Reactions Cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur rarely which may progress to liver failure> the drug should be discontinued if this occurs. Liver function abnormalities including isolated transaminase elevations have been reported. Dermatologic Reactions Allergic skin reactions e.g. pruritus erythema urticaria and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions occur in 1.5% of glyburide-treated patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use> if skin reactions persist the drug should be discontinued. Postmarketing Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergic: Angioedema arthralgia myalgia and vasculitis have been reported. Dermatologic: Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic: Leukopenia agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia which occasionally may present as purpura hemolytic anemia aplastic anemia and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic: Hepatic porphyria reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas> however these have not been reported with glyburide. Disulfiram-like reactions have been reported very rarely with glyburide. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with glyburide and all other sulfonylureas most often in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone. Other Reactions: Changes in accommodation and/or blurred vision have been reported with glyburide and other sulfonylureas.

b3efaffa-9ef9-4a4f-998e-aa7d2eb61fc9,ADVERSE REACTIONS Fluconazole is generally well tolerated. In some patients particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer changes in renal and hematological function test results and hepatic abnormalities have been observed during treatment with fluconazole and comparative agents but the clinical significance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. In Patients Receiving Multiple Doses for Other Infections Sixteen percent of over 4000 patients treated with fluconazole in clinical trials of 7 days or more experienced adverse events. Treatment was discontinued in 1.5% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.3% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities. Clinical adverse events were reported more frequently in HIV infected patients (21%) than in non-HIV infected patients (13%)> however the patterns in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients were similar. The proportions of patients discontinuing therapy due to clinical adverse events were similar in the two groups (1.5%). The following treatment-related clinical adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in 4048 patients receiving fluconazole for 7 or more days in clinical trials: nausea 3.7% headache 1.9% skin rash 1.8% vomiting 1.7% abdominal pain 1.7% and diarrhea 1.5%. Hepato-biliary In combined clinical trials and marketing experience there have been rare cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with fluconazole. (See WARNINGS ) The spectrum of these hepatic reactions has ranged from mild transient elevations in transaminases to clinical hepatitis cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure including fatalities. Instances of fatal hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly AIDS or malignancy) and often while taking multiple concomitant medications. Transient hepatic reactions including hepatitis and jaundice have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. In each of these cases liver function returned to baseline on discontinuation of fluconazole. In two comparative trials evaluating the efficacy of fluconazole for the suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis a statistically significant increase was observed in median AST (SGOT) levels from a baseline value of 30 IU/L to 41 IU/L in one trial and 34 IU/L to 66 IU/L in the other. The overall rate of serum transaminase elevations of more than 8 times the upper limit of normal was approximately 1% in fluconazole-treated patients in clinical trials. These elevations occurred in patients with severe underlying disease predominantly AIDS or malignancies most of whom were receiving multiple concomitant medications including many known to be hepatotoxic. The incidence of abnormally elevated serum transaminases was greater in patients taking fluconazole concomitantly with one or more of the following medications: rifampin phenytoin isoniazid valproic acid or oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents. Post-Marketing Experience In addition the following adverse events have occurred during post-marketing experience: Immunologic: In rare cases anaphylaxis (including angioedema face edema and pruritus) has been reported. Body as a Whole: Asthenia fatigue fever malaise. Cardiovascular: QT prolongation torsade de pointes. (See PRECAUTIONS ) Central Nervous System: Seizures dizziness. Hematopoietic and Lymphatic: Leukopenia including neutropenia and agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia. Metabolic: Hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia hypokalemia.

Skin and Appendages: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis drug eruption including fixed drug eruption increased sweating exfoliative skin disorders including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (See WARNINGS ) alopecia. Adverse Reactions in Children The pattern and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities recorded during pediatric clinical trials are comparable to those seen in adults. In Phase II/III clinical trials conducted in the United States and in Europe 577 pediatric patients ages 1 day to 17 years were treated with fluconazole at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day for up to 1616 days. Thirteen percent of children experienced treatment-related adverse events. The most commonly reported events were vomiting (5%) abdominal pain (3%) nausea (2%) and diarrhea (2%). Treatment was discontinued in 2.3% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.4% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities.

SPORANOX has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease treatment should be discontinued and liver function testing performed. The risks and benefits of SPORANOX use should be reassessed. (See WARNINGS: Hepatic Effects and PRECAUTIONS: Hepatotoxicity and Information for Patients .) Adverse Events Reported in Oropharyngeal or Esophageal Candidiasis Trials U.S. adverse experience data are derived from 350 immunocompromised patients (332 HIV seropositive/AIDS) treated for oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis. Table 3 below lists adverse events reported by at least 2% of patients treated with SPORANOX Oral Solution in U.S. clinical trials. Data on patients receiving comparator agents in these trials are included for comparison.

Post-marketing Experience Adverse drug reactions that have been first identified during post-marketing experience with SPORANOX (all formulations) are listed in Table 4 below. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size reliably estimating their frequency or establishing a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always possible. There is limited information on the use of SPORANOX during pregnancy. Cases of congenital abnormalities including skeletal genitourinary tract cardiovascular and ophthalmic malformations as well as chromosomal and multiple malformations have been reported during post-marketing experience.

Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole patients should be specifically warned about these reactions and should be told to stop the drug and report immediately to their physicians if any neurologic symptoms occur. In addition patients have reported headache syncope dizziness vertigo incoordination ataxia confusion dysarthria irritability depression weakness and insomnia (see WARNINGS ). Gastrointestinal The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract particularly nausea sometimes accompanied by headache anorexia and occasionally vomiting> diarrhea> epigastric distress> and abdominal cramping and constipation.

66bf60fa-61ac-47a7-a081-36077af9007e,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The adverse experiences for clonazepam are provided separately for patients with seizure disorders and with panic disorder. Seizure Disorders: The most frequently occurring side effects of clonazepam are referable to CNS depression. Experience in treatment of seizures has shown that drowsiness has occurred in approximately 50% of patients and ataxia in approximately 30%. In some cases these may diminish with time> behavior problems have been noted in approximately 25% of patients. Others listed by system including those identified during postapproval use of clonazepam are: Cardiovascular: Palpitations Dermatologic: Hair loss hirsutism skin rash ankle and facial edema Gastrointestinal: Anorexia coated tongue constipation diarrhea dry mouth encopresis gastritis increased appetite nausea sore gums Genitourinary: Dysuria enuresis nocturia urinary retention Hematopoietic: Anemia leukopenia thrombocytopenia eosinophilia Hepatic: Hepatomegaly transient elevations of serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase Musculoskeletal: Muscle weakness pains Miscellaneous: Dehydration general deterioration fever lymphadenopathy weight loss or gain Neurologic: Abnormal eye movements aphonia choreiform movements coma diplopia dysarthria dysdiadochokinesis ""glassy-eyed"" appearance headache hemiparesis hypotonia nystagmus respiratory depression slurred speech tremor vertigo Psychiatric: Confusion depression amnesia hallucinations hysteria increased libido insomnia psychosis (the behavior effects are more likely to occur in patients with a history of psychiatric disturbances). The following paradoxical reactions have been observed: excitability irritability aggressive behavior agitation nervousness hostility anxiety sleep disturbances nightmares and vivid dreams Respiratory: Chest congestion rhinorrhea shortness of breath hypersecretion in upper respiratory passages Panic Disorder: Adverse events during exposure to clonazepam were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow CIGY dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events except in certain cases in which redundant terms were collapsed into more meaningful terms as noted below. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials: Adverse Events Associated With Discontinuation of Treatment: Overall the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events was 17% in clonazepam compared to 9% for placebo in the combined data of two 6- to 9-week trials. The most common events (>1%) associated with discontinuation and a dropout rate twice or greater for clonazepam than that of placebo included the following: Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Clonazepam-Treated Patients: Table 3 enumerates the incidence rounded to the nearest percent of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during acute therapy of panic disorder from a pool of two 6- to 9-week trials. Events reported in 1% or more of patients treated with clonazepam (doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/day) and for which the incidence was greater than that in placebo-treated patients are included. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in Table 3 cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events: Treatment-Emergent Depressive Symptoms: In the pool of two short-term placebo-controlled trials adverse events classified under the preferred term ""depression"" were reported in 7% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients without any clear pattern of dose relatedness. In these same trials adverse events classified under the preferred term ""depression"" were reported as leading to discontinuation in 4% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. While these findings are noteworthy Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression. Other Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Clonazepam in Panic Disorder: Following is a list of modified CIGY terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with clonazepam at multiple doses during clinical trials. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling those events for which a drug cause was remote those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. It is important to emphasize that although the events occurred during treatment with clonazepam they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency. These adverse events were reported infrequently which is defined as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients.

593d8ca3-c303-4512-96a6-d4860e02cd83,ADVERSE EXPERIENCES Over 1000 patients from both controlled and open trials with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets in hypertension and angina were included in the evaluation of adverse experiences. All side effects reported during Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet therapy were tabulated independent of their causal relation to medication. The most common side effect reported with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets was edema which was dose related and ranged in frequency from approximately 10% to about 30% at the highest dose studied (180 mg). Other common adverse experiences reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Of these only edema and headache were more common in Nifedipine Extended-release Tablet patients than placebo patients. The following adverse reactions occurred with an incidence of less than 3%. With the exception of leg cramps the incidence of these side effects was similar to that of placebo alone. Body as a Whole/Systemic: asthenia flushing pain Cardiovascular: palpitations Central Nervous System: insomnia nervousness paresthesia somnolence Dermatologic: pruritus rash Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain diarrhea dry mouth dyspepsia flatulence Musculoskeletal: arthralgia leg cramps Respiratory: chest pain (nonspecific) dyspnea Urogenital: impotence polyuria Other adverse reactions were reported sporadically with an incidence of 1% or less. These include: Body as a Whole/Systemic: face edema fever hot flashes malaise periorbital edema rigors Cardiovascular: arrhythmia hypotension increased angina tachycardia syncope Central Nervous System: anxiety ataxia decreased libido depression hypertonia hypoesthesia migraine paroniria tremor vertigo Dermatologic: alopecia increased sweating urticaria purpura Gastrointestinal: eructation gastroesophageal reflux gum hyperplasia melena vomiting weight increase Musculoskeletal: back pain gout myalgias Respiratory: coughing epistaxis upper respiratory tract infection respiratory disorder sinusitis Special Senses: abnormal lacrimation abnormal vision taste perversion tinnitus Urogenital/Reproductive: breast pain dysuria hematuria nocturia Adverse experiences which occurred in less than 1 in 1000 patients cannot be distinguished from concurrent disease states or medications. The following adverse experiences reported in less than 1% of patients occurred under conditions (e.g. open trials marketing experience) where a causal relationship is uncertain: gastrointestinal irritation gastrointestinal bleeding gynecomastia. Gastrointestinal obstruction resulting in hospitalization and surgery including the need for bezoar removal has occurred in association with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets even in patients with no prior history of gastrointestinal disease (see WARNINGS ). Cases of tablet adherence to the gastrointestinal wall with ulceration have been reported some requiring hospitalization and intervention. In multiple-dose U.S. and foreign controlled studies with nifedipine capsules in which adverse reactions were reported spontaneously adverse effects were frequent but generally not serious and rarely required discontinuation of therapy or dosage adjustment. Most were expected consequences of the vasodilator effects of nifedipine. There is also a large uncontrolled experience in over 2100 patients in the United States. Most of the patients had vasospastic or resistant angina pectoris and about half had concomitant treatment with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. The relatively common adverse events were similar in nature to those seen with Nifedipine Extended-release Tablets. In addition more serious adverse events were observed not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. It remains possible however that some or many of these events were drug related. Myocardial infarction occurred in about 4% of patients and congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema in about 2%. Ventricular arrhythmias or conduction disturbances each occurred in fewer than 0.5% of patients. In a subgroup of over 1000 patients receiving nifedipine with concomitant beta blocker therapy the pattern and incidence of adverse experiences was not different from that of the entire group of nifedipine-treated patients (see PRECAUTIONS ). In a subgroup of approximately 250 patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure as well as angina dizziness or lightheadedness peripheral edema headache or flushing each occurred in one in eight patients. Hypotension occurred in about one in 20 patients. Syncope occurred in approximately one patient in 250. Myocardial infarction or symptoms of congestive heart failure each occurred in about one patient in 15. Atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias each occurred in about one patient in 150. In post-marketing experience there have been rare reports of exfoliative dermatitis caused by nifedipine. There have been rare reports of exfoliative or bullous skin adverse events (such as erythema multiforme Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) and photosensitivity reactions.

f5716b57-6e5c-4c89-9d4e-5be0bc86c5be,ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious Adverse Reactions Deaths have occurred in patients who received flumazenil in a variety of clinical settings. The majority of deaths occurred in patients with serious underlying disease or in patients who had ingested large amounts of non-benzodiazepine drugs (usually cyclic antidepressants) as part of an overdose. Serious adverse events have occurred in all clinical settings and convulsions are the most common serious adverse events reported. Flumazenil administration has been associated with the onset of convulsions in patients with severe hepatic impairment and in patients who are relying on benzodiazepine effects to control seizures are physically dependent on benzodiazepines or who have ingested large doses of other drugs (mixed-drug overdose) (see WARNINGS ). Two of the 446 patients who received flumazenil in controlled clinical trials for the management of a benzodiazepine overdose had cardiac dysrhythmias (1 ventricular tachycardia 1 junctional tachycardia). Adverse Events in Clinical Studies The following adverse reactions were considered to be related to flumazenil administration (both alone and for the reversal of benzodiazepine effects) and were reported in studies involving 1875 individuals who received flumazenil in controlled trials. Adverse events most frequently associated with flumazenil alone were limited to dizziness injection site pain increased sweating headache and abnormal or blurred vision (3% to 9%). Body as a Whole: fatigue (asthenia malaise) headache injection site pain* injection site reaction (thrombophlebitis skin abnormality rash) Cardiovascular System: cutaneous vasodilation (sweating flushing hot flushes) Digestive System: nausea vomiting (11%) Nervous System: agitation (anxiety nervousness dry mouth tremor palpitations insomnia dyspnea hyperventilation)* dizziness (vertigo ataxia) (10%) emotional lability (crying abnormal depersonalization euphoria increased tears depression dysphoria paranoia) Special Senses: abnormal vision (visual field defect diplopia) paresthesia (sensation abnormal hypoesthesia) All adverse reactions occurred in 1% to 3% of cases unless otherwise marked. *indicates reaction in 3% to 9% of cases. Observed percentage reported if greater than 9%. The following adverse events were observed infrequently (less than 1%) in the clinical studies but were judged as probably related to flumazenil administration and/or reversal of benzodiazepine effects: Nervous System: confusion (difficulty concentrating delirium) convulsions (see WARNINGS) somnolence (stupor) Special Senses: abnormal hearing (transient hearing impairment hyperacusis tinnitus) The following adverse events occurred with frequencies less than 1% in the clinical trials. Their relationship to flumazenil administration is unknown but they are included as alerting information for the physician. Body as a Whole: rigors shivering Cardiovascular System: arrhythmia (atrial nodal ventricular extrasystoles) bradycardia tachycardia hypertension chest pain. Digestive System: hiccup Nervous System: speech disorder (dysphonia thick tongue) Not included in this list is operative site pain that occurred with the same frequency in patients receiving placebo as in patients receiving flumazenil for reversal of sedation following a surgical procedure.

55e65285-9917-481c-9a28-bad76d47da3e,ADVERSE REACTIONS In U.S. and foreign controlled studies the frequency of serious adverse reactions reported was very low. Of 702 patients 11.8% reported adverse reactions and in only 1.5% was glipizide discontinued. Hypoglycemia See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE sections. Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal disturbances are the most common reactions. Gastrointestinal complaints were reported with the following approximate incidence: nausea and diarrhea one in seventy> constipation and gastralgia one in one hundred. They appear to be dose-related and may disappear on division or reduction of dosage. Cholestatic jaundice may occur rarely with sulfonylureas: Glipizide should be discontinued if this occurs. Dermatologic Allergic skin reactions including erythema morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions urticaria pruritus and eczema have been reported in about one in seventy patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of glipizide> if skin reactions persist the drug should be discontinued. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic Leukopenia agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia hemolytic anemia (see PRECAUTIONS ) aplastic anemia and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. In the mouse glipizide pretreatment did not cause an accumulation of acetaldehyde after ethanol administration. Clinical experience to date has shown that glipizide has an extremely low incidence of disulfiram-like alcohol reactions. Endocrine Reactions Cases of hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion have been reported with this and other sulfonylureas.

6135944c-3ee2-4491-9704-33f56ad435f4,ADVERSE REACTIONS Drowsiness dizziness amenorrhea blurred vision skin reactions and hypotension may occur. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see WARNINGS ). Cholestatic jaundice has occurred. If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs appropriate liver studies should be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality stop treatment. There have been a few observations of fatty changes in the livers of patients who have died while receiving the drug. No causal relationship has been established. Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have occurred. Warn patients to report the sudden appearance of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential counts indicate leukocyte depression stop treatment and start antibiotic and other suitable therapy. Neuromuscular (Extrapyramidal) Reactions These symptoms are seen in a significant number of hospitalized mental patients. They may be characterized by motor restlessness be of the dystonic type or they may resemble parkinsonism. Depending on the severity of symptoms dosage should be reduced or discontinued. If therapy is reinstituted it should be at a lower dosage. Should these symptoms occur in children or pregnant patients the drug should be stopped and not reinstituted. In most cases barbiturates by suitable route of administration will suffice or injectable diphenhydramine may be useful. In more severe cases the administration of an antiparkinsonism agent except levodopa usually produces rapid reversal of symptoms. Suitable supportive measures such as maintaining a clear airway and adequate hydration should be employed. Motor Restlessness Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided. If these symptoms become too troublesome they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with antiparkinsonian agents benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful. Dystonia Class effect : Symptoms of dystonia prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat swallowing difficulty difficulty breathing and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Pseudoparkinsonism Symptoms may include mask-like facies drooling tremors pillrolling motion cogwheel rigidity and shuffling gait. Reassurance and sedation are important. In most cases these symptoms are readily controlled when an antiparkinsonism agent is administered concomitantly. Antiparkinsonism agents should be used only when required. Generally therapy of a few weeks to two or three months will suffice. After this time patients should be evaluated to determine their need for continued treatment. (Note: Levodopa has not been found effective in pseudoparkinsonism.) Occasionally it is necessary to lower the dosage of prochlorperazine or to discontinue the drug. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop although much less frequently after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients especially elderly women it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue face mouth or jaw (e.g. protrusion of tongue puffing of cheeks puckering of mouth chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia tardive dystonia has also been described. There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia> antiparkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment or increase the dosage of the agent or switch to a different antipsychotic agent the syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. Contact Dermatitis Avoid getting the injection solution on hands or clothing because of the possibility of contact dermatitis. Adverse Reactions Reported with Prochlorperazine or Other Phenothiazine Derivatives Adverse reactions with different phenothiazines vary in type frequency and the mechanism of occurrence i.e. some are dose-related while others involve individual patient sensitivity. Some adverse reactions may be more likely to occur or occur with greater intensity in patients with special medical problems e.g. patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses of certain phenothiazines. Not all of the following adverse reactions have been observed with every phenothiazine derivative but they have been reported with one or more and should be borne in mind when drugs of this class are administered: extrapyramidal symptoms (opisthotonos oculogyric crisis hyperreflexia dystonias akathisia dyskinesia parkinsonism) some of which have lasted months and even years particularly in elderly patients with previous brain damage> grand mal and petit mal convulsions particularly in patients with EEG abnormalities or history of such disorders> altered cerebrospinal fluid proteins> cerebral edema> intensification and prolongation of the action of central nervous system depressants (opiates analgesics antihistamines barbiturates alcohol) atropine heat organophosphorus insecticides> autonomic reactions (dryness of mouth nasal congestion headache nausea constipation obstipation adynamic ileus ejaculatory disorders/impotence priapism atonic colon urinary retention miosis and mydriasis)> reactivation of psychotic processes catatonic-like states> hypotension (sometimes fatal)> cardiac arrest> blood dyscrasias (pancytopenia thrombocytopenic purpura leukopenia agranulocytosis eosinophilia hemolytic anemia aplastic anemia)> liver damage (jaundice biliary stasis)> endocrine disturbances (hyperglycemia hypoglycemia glycosuria lactation galactorrhea gynecomastia menstrual irregularities false-positive pregnancy tests)> skin disorders (photosensitivity itching erythema urticaria eczema up to exfoliative dermatitis)> other allergic reactions (asthma laryngeal edema angioneurotic edema anaphylactoid reactions)> peripheral edema> reversed epinephrine effect> hyperpyrexia> mild fever after large IM doses> increased appetite> increased weight> a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome> pigmentary retinopathy> with prolonged administration of substantial doses skin pigmentation epithelial keratopathy and lenticular and corneal deposits. EKG changes- particularly nonspecific usually reversible Q- and T-wave distortions- have been observed in some patients receiving phenothiazines. Although phenothiazines cause neither psychic nor physical dependence sudden discontinuation in long-term psychiatric patients may cause temporary symptoms e.g. nausea and vomiting dizziness tremulousness. NOTE: There have been occasional reports of sudden death in patients receiving phenothiazines. In some cases the cause appeared to be cardiac arrest or asphyxia due to failure of the cough reflex.,"drowsiness, dizziness amenorrhea, blurred, vision, skin hypotension, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, association, antipsychotic drugs, cholestatic jaundice, fever, grippe-like symptoms, liver studies, tests, abnormality, stop, treatment, observations, fatty, livers, died,  relationship, leukopenia agranulocytosis, sudden appearance, sore throat, signs infection, white blood cell, leukocyte, treatment, antibiotic, therapy, neuromuscular extrapyramidal, symptoms, hospitalized,  motor restlessness dystonic type, parkinsonism, severity, symptoms, dosage, discontinued, therapy, symptoms, children, pregnant   barbitu route administration, injectable diphenhydramine, severe, administration, antiparkinsonism agent, levodopa, reversal symptoms, supportive measures, airway, adequate, hydration, motor restlessness, symptoms, agitation, jitteriness, insomnia, symptoms, spontaneously, symptoms, neurotic psychotic symptoms, dosage, symptoms, reduction, dosage,  treatment, antiparkinsonian agents, benzodiazepines, dystonia, class effect, symptoms, dystonia, prolonged, abnormal, contractions, muscle, groups, susceptible, individuals, days, treatment, dystonic, symptoms, spasm neck muscles, tightness throat, swallowing, difficulty, difficulty, breathing, symptoms, low doses, severity, high potency, doses, antipsychotic drugs, elevated, males, younger age, pseudoparkinsonism symptoms, mask-like facies, motion cogwheel rigidity shuffling gait, reassurance, sedation,  symptoms, antiparkinsonism agent, administered, antiparkinsonism agents, therapy, weeks, months, treatment, levodopa, effective, pseudoparkinsonism, dosage, prochlorperazine, discontinue,  tardive dyskinesia, antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia, long-term, therapy, drug therapy, discontinued, syndrome, treatment, low doses, syndrome, age groups, prevalence, elderly, elderly women, prevalence,  inception, antipsychotic, treatment, syndrome, symptoms, persistent, irreversible, syndrome, rhythmical, involuntary movements, face mouth jaw, protrusion tongue, puffing cheeks, movements, involuntary movements extremities, involuntary movements, extremities, manifestations, tardive dyskinesia, variant, tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, effective, treatment, dyskinesia, antiparkinsonism agents, symptoms syndrome, antipsychotic agents, discontinued, symptoms, reinstitute, treatment, increase, dosage agent, antipsychotic agent syndrome, fine, vermicular, tongue, syndrome, medication, time syndrome, contact dermatitis, injection, contact dermatitis, prochlorperazine, phenothiazine derivatives, phenothiazines, type frequency mechanism, occurrence, dose-related, individual, patient, sensitivity, intensity, medical problems, mitral insufficiency pheochromocytoma, severe, hypotension, doses, phenothiazines, phenothiazine derivative, drugs, administered, extrapyramidal symptoms, oculogyric crisis, parkinsonism, months,  elderly, brain damage, mal petit mal, convulsions, eeg abnormalities, history disorders, cerebrospinal fluid proteins, cerebral edema, intensification, prolongation, action, central nervous system, depressants, opiates, analgesics antihistamines, barbitu alcohol atropine, heat organophosphorus insecticides, autonomic dryness mouth, nasal congestion headache nausea constipation obstipation adynamic, ejaculatory disorders, impotence priapism, atonic colon, urinary retention, miosis mydriasis, reactivation, psychotic processes, catatonic-like states, hypotension, fatal, cardiac arrest, blood dyscrasias pancytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura leukopenia agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, liver damage jaundice, biliary stasis, endocrine disturbances, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, glycosuria, lactation, galactorrhea gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, false-positive, skin disorders, photosensitivity itching erythema urticaria eczema, exfoliative dermatitis, allergic asthma, laryngeal edema, angioneurotic edema, anaphylactoid peripheral edema, epinephrine, effect, hyperpyrexia, mild fever, doses, weight systemic lupus, erythematosus-like syndrome, pigmentary retinopathy, prolonged, administration, doses, skin pigmentation, epithelial keratopathy, lenticular, nonspecific, reversible, q- t-wave, phenothiazines, phenothiazines, psychic physical, sudden discontinuation, long-term, psychiatric, temporary, symptoms, nausea vomiting, dizziness tremulousness, reports, sudden death, phenothiazines,  cardiac arrest, asphyxia, failure cough reflex"

However since thiothixene has certain chemical and pharmacologic similarities to the phenothiazines all of the known side effects and toxicity associated with phenothiazine therapy should be borne in mind when thiothixene capsules are used. Cardiovascular Effects Tachycardia hypotension light-headedness and syncope. In the event hypotension occurs epinephrine should not be used as a pressor agent since a paradoxical further lowering of blood pressure may result. Nonspecific EKG changes have been observed in some patients receiving thiothixene. These changes are usually reversible and frequently disappear on continued thiothixene therapy. The incidence of these changes is lower than that observed with some phenothiazines. The clinical significance of these changes is not known. CNS Effects Drowsiness usually mild may occur although it usually subsides with continuation of thiothixene therapy. The incidence of sedation appears similar to that of the piperazine group of phenothiazines but less than that of certain aliphatic phenothiazines. Restlessness agitation and insomnia have been noted with thiothixene. Seizures and paradoxical exacerbation of psychotic symptoms have occurred with thiothixene infrequently. Hyperreflexia has been reported in infants delivered from mothers having received structurally related drugs. In addition phenothiazine derivatives have been associated with cerebral edema and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities. Extrapyramidal Symptoms Extrapyramidal symptoms such as pseudoparkinsonism akathisia and dystonia have been reported (see Adverse Reactions: Dystonia: Class Effect ). Management of these extra-pyramidal symptoms depends upon the type and severity. Rapid relief of acute symptoms may require the use of an injectable antiparkinson agent. More slowly emerging symptoms may be managed by reducing the dosage of thiothixene capsules and/or administering an oral antiparkinson agent. Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat swallowing difficulty difficulty breathing and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Persistent Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy with thiothixene (1) or may occur after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue face mouth or jaw (e.g. protrusion of tongue puffing of cheeks puckering of mouth chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. Since early detection of tardive dyskinesia is important patients should be monitored on an ongoing basis. It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome. If this or any other presentation of the syndrome is observed the clinician should consider possible discontinuation of antipsychotic medication (see WARNINGS ). Hepatic Effects Elevations of serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase usually transient have been infrequently observed in some patients. No clinically confirmed cases of jaundice attributable to thiothixene have been reported. Hematologic Effects As is true with certain other psychotropic drugs leukopenia and leukocytosis which are usually transient can occur occasionally with thiothixene. Other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis eosinophilia hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. Allergic Reactions Rash pruritus urticaria photosensitivity and rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with thiothixene. Undue exposure to sunlight should be avoided. Although not experienced with thiothixene exfoliative dermatitis and contact dermatitis (in nursing personnel) have been reported with certain phenothiazines. Endocrine/Reproductive Hyperprolactinemia (3) lactation menstrual irregularities moderate breast enlargement and amenorrhea have occurred in a small percentage of females receiving thiothixene. If persistent this may necessitate a reduction in dosage or the discontinuation of therapy. Phenothiazines have been associated with false positive pregnancy tests gynecomastia hypoglycemia hyperglycemia and glycosuria. Autonomic Effects Dry mouth blurred vision nasal congestion constipation increased sweating increased salivation and impotence have occurred infrequently with thiothixene therapy. Phenothiazines have been associated with miosis mydriasis and adynamic ileus. Other Adverse Reactions Hyperpyrexia anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea increase in appetite and weight weakness or fatigue polydipsia and peripheral edema. Although not reported with thiothixene evidence indicates there is a relationship between phenothiazine therapy and the occurrence of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Please refer to the text regarding NMS in the WARNINGS section. NOTE: Sudden deaths have occasionally been reported in patients who have received certain phenothiazine derivatives. In some cases the cause of death was apparently cardiac arrest or asphyxia due to failure of the cough reflex. In others the cause could not be determined nor could it be established that death was due to phenothiazine administration.,"thiothixene, thiothixene, chemical, pharmacologic, phenothiazines, side effects, toxicity, phenothiazine therapy, thiothixene capsules, cardiovascular effects, tachycardia, hypotension, light-headedness syncope, event, hypotension, epinephrine, pressor agent, paradoxical, blood pressure, nonspecific, ekg, thiothixene, disappear, thiothixene therapy,  phenothiazines, significance, cns, mild, continuation, thiothixene therapy,  sedation, piperazine, phenothiazines, aliphatic phenothiazines, restlessness agitation, insomnia, thiothixene, seizures, paradoxical, exacerbation, psychotic symptoms, thiothixene, hyperreflexia, infants, mothers, structurally related, drugs, phenothiazine derivatives, cerebral edema, cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities, extrapyramidal symptoms, extrapyramidal symptoms, pseudoparkinsonism akathisia dystonia, dystonia, class effect, management, extra-pyramidal symptoms, type severity, relief, acute, symptoms, injectable antiparkinson agent, symptoms, reducing, dosage, thiothixene capsules, oral antiparkinson agent, dystonia, class effect, symptoms, dystonia, prolonged, abnormal, contractions, muscle, groups, susceptible, individuals, days, treatment, dystonic, symptoms, spasm neck muscles, tightness throat, swallowing, difficulty, difficulty, breathing, symptoms, low doses, severity, high potency, doses, antipsychotic drugs, elevated, males, younger age groups, persistent, tardive dyskinesia, antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia, long-term, therapy thiothixene, drug therapy, discontinued, syndrome, rhythmical, involuntary movements, face mouth jaw, protrusion tongue, puffing cheeks, movements, involuntary movements extremities, detection, tardive dyskinesia, fine, vermicular, presentation, syndrome, clinician, discontinuation, antipsychotic medication, hepatic, elevations, serum transaminase alkaline phosphatase, transient,  clinically,  jaundice, thiothixene, hematologic effects, psychotropic drugs, leukopenia, leukocytosis, transient, thiothixene, antipsychotic drugs, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia pancytopenia, allergic rash, pruritus urticaria, photosensitivity,  anaphylaxis thiothixene, exposure sunlight, thiothixene exfoliative dermatitis, contact dermatitis, nursing personnel, phenothiazines, endocrine, hyperprolactinemia, lactation, menstrual irregularities, moderate, breast enlargement, amenorrhea, females, thiothixene, persistent, reduction, dosage, phenothiazines, false positive pregnancy tests, gynecomastia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia glycosuria, autonomic effects, dry mouth, blurred, vision, nasal congestion constipation, sweating salivation, impotence, thiothixene therapy, phenothiazines, miosis mydriasis, adynamic ileus, hyperpyrexia anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea, increase, appetite weight weakness, fatigue, peripheral edema, thiothixene, evidence, relationship, phenothiazine therapy, occurrence, systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, nms  sudden deaths, phenothiazine derivatives,  death, cardiac arrest, asphyxia, failure cough reflex, death, phenothiazine, administration"

018858b3-3f2d-47e4-bff3-823b97a61629,ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects to Alprazolam Tablets if they occur are generally observed at the beginning of therapy and usually disappear upon continued medication. In the usual patient the most frequent side effects are likely to be an extension of the pharmacological activity of alprazolam eg drowsiness or light-headedness. The data cited in the two tables below are estimates of untoward clinical event incidence among patients who participated under the following clinical conditions: relatively short duration (ie four weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 4 mg/day of alprazolam (for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety) and short-term (up to ten weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 10 mg/day of alprazolam in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. These data cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors often differ from those in clinical trials. These figures cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials are conducted under a different set of conditions. Comparison of the cited figures however can provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the untoward event incidence in the population studied. Even this use must be approached cautiously as a drug may relieve a symptom in one patient but induce it in others. (For example an anxiolytic drug may relieve dry mouth [a symptom of anxiety] in some subjects but induce it [an untoward event] in others.) Additionally for anxiety disorders the cited figures can provide the prescriber with an indication as to the frequency with which physician intervention (eg increased surveillance decreased dosage or discontinuation of drug therapy) may be necessary because of the untoward clinical event. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported in Placebo-Controlled Trials of Anxiety Disorders In addition to the relatively common (i.e. greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated in the table above the following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines: dystonia irritability concentration difficulties anorexia transient amnesia or memory impairment loss of coordination fatigue seizures sedation slurred speech jaundice musculoskeletal weakness pruritus diplopia dysarthria changes in libido menstrual irregularities incontinence and urinary retention. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported in Placebo-Controlled Trials of Panic Disorder In addition to the relatively common (ie greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated in the table above the following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam: seizures hallucinations depersonalization taste alterations diplopia elevated bilirubin elevated hepatic enzymes and jaundice. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients (see PRECAUTIONS General ). Adverse Events Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation in Treatment of Panic Disorder in Placebo-Controlled Trials In a larger database comprised of both controlled and uncontrolled studies in which 641 patients received alprazolam discontinuation-emergent symptoms which occurred at a rate of over 5% in patients treated with alprazolam and at a greater rate than the placebo treated group were as follows: From the studies cited it has not been determined whether these symptoms are clearly related to the dose and duration of therapy with alprazolam in patients with panic disorder. There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of Alprazolam Tablets (see WARNINGS ). To discontinue treatment in patients taking alprazolam the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of alprazolam be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose> however the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. As with all benzodiazepines paradoxical reactions such as stimulation increased muscle spasticity sleep disturbances hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation rage irritability and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability hostility and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Post Introduction Reports Various adverse drug reactions have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam since market introduction. The majority of these reactions were reported through the medical event voluntary reporting system. Because of the spontaneous nature of the reporting of medical events and the lack of controls a causal relationship to the use of alprazolam cannot be readily determined. Reported events include: gastrointestinal disorder hypomania mania liver enzyme elevations hepatitis hepatic failure Stevens-Johnson syndrome photosensitivity reaction angioedema peripheral edema hyperprolactinemia gynecomastia and galactorrhea (see PRECAUTI,"side effects, alprazolam, therapy, disappear, continued, medication, patient, frequent, side effects, extension, pharmacological activity, alprazolam, drowsiness light-headedness,  tables,  event,  conditions, weeks, placebo-controlled studies, dosages, day, alprazolam, management, anxiety disorders, short-term, relief symptoms, anxiety, short-term, weeks, placebo-controlled studies, dosages, day, alprazolam, panic disorder, agoraphobia,   medical practice, patient, characteristics, trials, figures, studies, drug products, placebo, group  prescriber, contributions,  non-drug factors, event,    symptom, patient, induce, anxiolytic  dry mouth, symptom, anxiety  untoward, event, anxiety disorders, prescriber,  frequency, physician, intervention, surveillance dosage, discontinuation, drug therapy, event, placebo-controlled anxiety disorders, association, benzodiazepines dystonia, irritability, concentration, difficulties, transient, amnesia, memory impairment, loss coordination, fatigue seizures, sedation, slurred speech jaundice, musculoskeletal weakness, diplopia dysarthria, changes, libido, incontinence, urinary retention, placebo-controlled panic disorder, association, alprazolam, seizures, hallucinations, depersonalization taste alterations, diplopia, elevated, bilirubin, elevated, hepatic enzymes jaundice, panic disorder, depressive disorders, reports, suicide, un discontinuation, treatment panic disorder, studies, alprazolam, discontinuation-emergent symptoms, rate,  alprazolam, rate, placebo, treated group, studies, symptoms, dose, duration therapy, alprazolam, panic disorder, reports, withdrawal seizures, decrease, abrupt, discontinuation, alprazolam, discontinue, treatment, alprazolam, dosage, medical practice, daily, dosage, alprazolam, days, dosage, administration, benefit, dosage, reduction, postmarketing discontinuation study, panic disorder, recommended, taper schedule, taper schedule, groups, proportion, schedule, reduction, symptoms, withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepines, paradoxical, stimulation, hallucinations, behavioral, agitation, rage irritability, aggressive, hostile behavior, spontaneous, case reports, behavioral effects, cns drugs, psychiatric conditions, alprazolam, discontinued, isolated, published reports, small numbers, borderline, personality disorder, history, violent, aggressive behavior, alcohol substance abuse, risk events, irritability, hostility, intrusive thoughts, discontinuation, alprazolam, posttraumatic stress disorder, post, drug association, alprazolam, market, introduction, medical event, voluntary reporting system, spontaneous, medical lack controls, relationship, alprazolam, gastrointestinal disorder, hypomania mania, liver enzyme, elevations, hepatitis hepatic failure, stevens-johnson syndrome, photosensitivity reaction angioedema, peripheral edema, hyperprolactinemia gynecomastia galactorrhea, precauti"

7a2d0cf1-dabe-430d-90f7-74973cba48e3,ADVERSE REACTIONS Commonly Observed The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of clomipramine hydrochloride capsules and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients were gastrointestinal complaints including dry mouth constipation nausea dyspepsia and anorexia> nervous system complaints including somnolence tremor dizziness nervousness and myoclonus> genitourinary complaints including changed libido ejaculatory failure impotence and micturition disorder> and other miscellaneous complaints including fatigue sweating increased appetite weight gain and visual changes. Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment Approximately 20% of 3616 patients who received clomipramine hydrochloride capsules in U.S. premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Approximately one-half of the patients who discontinued (9% of the total) had multiple complaints none of which could be classified as primary. Where a primary reason for discontinuation could be identified most patients discontinued because of nervous system complaints (5.4%) primarily somnolence. The second-most-frequent reason for discontinuation was digestive system complaints (1.3%) primarily vomiting and nausea. There was no apparent relationship between the adverse events and elevated plasma drug concentrations. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials The following table enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater among patients with OCD who received clomipramine hydrochloride capsules in adult or pediatric placebo-controlled clinical trials. The frequencies were obtained from pooled data of clinical trials involving either adults receiving clomipramine hydrochloride capsules (N=322) or placebo (N=319) or children treated with clomipramine hydrochloride capsules (N=46) or placebo (N=44). The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the populations studied. Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experience in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials (Percentage of Patients Reporting Event) Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Clomipramine Hydrochloride Capsules During clinical testing in the U.S. multiple doses of clomipramine hydrochloride capsules were administered to approximately 3600 subjects. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow a modified World Health Organization dictionary of terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The frequencies presented therefore represent the proportion of the 3525 individuals exposed to clomipramine hydrochloride capsules who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving clomipramine hydrochloride capsules. All events are included except those already listed in the previous table those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those in which an association with the drug was remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with clomipramine hydrochloride capsules they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1000 patients.

Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole patients should be specifically warned about these reactions and should be told to stop the drug and report immediately to their physicians if any neurologic symptoms occur. In addition patients have reported headache syncope dizziness vertigo incoordination ataxia confusion dysarthria irritability depression weakness and insomnia (see WARNINGS ). Gastrointestinal The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract particularly nausea sometimes accompanied by headache anorexia and occasionally vomiting> diarrhea> epigastric distress> and abdominal cramping and constipation. Mouth A sharp unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue glossitis and stomatitis have occurred> these may be associated with a sudden overgrowth of Candida which may occur during therapy. Dermatologic Erythematous rash and pruritus. Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia)> rarely reversible thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Hypersensitivity Urticaria erythematous rash Stevens-Johnson Syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis flushing nasal congestion dryness of the mouth (or vagina or vulva) and fever. Renal Dysuria cystitis polyuria incontinence and a sense of pelvic pressure. Instances of darkened urine have been reported by approximately one patient in 100000. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance. Other Proliferation of Candida in the vagina dyspareunia decrease of libido proctitis and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling ""serum sickness."" Rare cases of pancreatitis which generally abated on withdrawal of the drug have been reported. Patients with Crohn's disease are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers. There have been some reports in the medical literature of breast and colon cancer in Crohn's disease patients who have been treated with metronidazole at high doses for extended periods of time.

7986b43a-74b5-a963-e053-2991aa0a669e,The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Rhabdomyolysis and myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Liver enzyme abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the atorvastatin calcium tablets placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16066 patients (8755 atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 7311 placebo> age range 10-93 years 39% women 91% Caucasians 3% Blacks 2% Asians 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks 9.7% of patients on atorvastatin calcium tablets and 9.5% of the patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%) diarrhea (0.5%) nausea (0.4%) alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%) and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence > 2% and greater than placebo) regardless of causality in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets in placebo controlled trials (n=8755) were: nasopharyngitis (8.3%) arthralgia (6.9%) diarrhea (6.8%) pain in extremity (6.0%) and urinary tract infection (5.7%). Table 3 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions regardless of causality reported in > 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets (n=8755) from seventeen placebo-controlled trials.

Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) In ASCOT [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] involving 10305 participants (age range 40-80 years 19% women> 94.6% Caucasians 2.6% Africans 1.5% South Asians 1.3% mixed/other) treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg daily (n=5168) or placebo (n=5137) the safety and tolerability profile of the group treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets was comparable to that of the group treated with placebo during a median of 3.3 years of follow-up. Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) In CARDS [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] involving 2838 subjects (age range 39-77 years 32% women> 94.3% Caucasians 2.4% South Asians 2.3% Afro-Caribbean 1.0% other) with type 2 diabetes treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg daily (n=1428) or placebo (n=1410) there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median follow-up of 3.9 years. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] involving 10001 subjects (age range 29-78 years 19% women> 94.1% Caucasians 2.9% Blacks 1.0% Asians 2.0% other) with clinically evident CHD treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 mg daily (n=5006) or atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg daily (n=4995) there were more serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the high-dose atorvastatin group (92 1.8%> 497 9.9% respectively) as compared to the low-dose group (69 1.4%> 404 8.1% respectively) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (>3 x ULN twice within 4-10 days) occurred in 62 (1.3%) individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in nine (0.2%) individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK (> 10 x ULN) were low overall but were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin treatment group (13 0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (6 0.1%). Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering Study (IDEAL) In IDEAL [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] involving 8888 subjects (age range 26-80 years 19% women> 99.3% Caucasians 0.4% Asians 0.3% Blacks 0.04% other) treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day (n=4439) or simvastatin 20-40 mg daily (n=4449) there was no difference in the overall frequency of adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions between the treatment groups during a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL involving 4731 subjects (age range 21-92 years 40% women> 93.3% Caucasians 3.0% Blacks 0.6% Asians 3.1% other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg (n=2365) or placebo (n=2366) for a median follow-up of 4.9 years there was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations (> 3 x ULN twice within 4- 10 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.1%). Elevations of CK (>>10 x ULN) were rare but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 144 subjects (6.1%) in the atorvastatin group and 89 subjects (3.8%) in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. In a post-hoc analysis atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (218/2365 9.2% vs. 274/2366 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (55/2365 2.3% vs. 33/2366 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Subjects who entered the study with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke [7 (16%) atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 2 (4%) placebo]. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for all-cause mortality: 216 (9.1%) in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg/day group vs. 211 (8.9%) in the placebo group. The proportions of subjects who experienced cardiovascular death were numerically smaller in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group (3.3%) than in the placebo group (4.1%). The proportions of subjects who experienced non-cardiovascular death were numerically larger in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group (5.0%) than in the placebo group (4.0%). Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies of atorvastatin calcium tablets in Pediatric Patients In a 26-week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls with HeFH (ages 10 years to 17 years) (n=140 31% female> 92% Caucasians 1.6% Blacks 1.6% Asians 4.8% other) the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin calcium tablets 10 to 20 mg daily as an adjunct to diet to reduce total cholesterol LDL-C and apo B levels was generally similar to that of placebo [see Use in Special Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atorvastatin calcium tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin calcium tablets therapy reported since market introduction that are not listed above regardless of causality assessment include the following: anaphylaxis angioneurotic edema bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) rhabdomyolysis myositis fatigue tendon rupture fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure dizziness depression peripheral neuropathy pancreatitis and interstitial lung disease. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g. memory loss forgetfulness amnesia memory impairment confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious and reversible upon statin discontinuation with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 w,"detail  rhabdomyolysis, liver enzyme abnormalities, conditions, reaction,      practice, atorvastatin, calcium placebo-controlled trial database, atorvastatin, calcium, placebo age,  women, caucasians, asians, median, treatment, weeks, atorvastatin, calcium, placebo, discontinued, causality,  atorvastatin, calcium, treatment discontinuation, rate, placebo myalgia, diarrhea, nausea, alanine aminotransferase, increase, hepatic enzyme, increase,  placebo, causality,  atorvastatin, calcium placebo, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhea, pain extremity, urinary tract infection, frequency, causality rate, placebo,  atorvastatin, calcium, placebo-controlled trials,  dose, atorvastatin, calcium,  placebo, causality, reaction dose, placebo, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhea, pain extremity, urinary tract infection, dyspepsia, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasms, myalgia, insomnia, pharyngolaryngeal pain, reaction dose, placebo, placebo-controlled studies, body whole malaise pyrexia, digestive system, abdominal discomfort, hepatitis cholestasis, musculoskeletal system, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue neck pain joint, metabolic, nutritional system, transaminases, increase, liver function test, abnormal, blood alkaline phosphatase, increase, creatine phosphokinase, increase, hyperglycemia, nervous system, respiratory system, skin appendages, vision, blurred, tinnitus, urogenital system, white blood cells, urine positive, anglo-scandinavian, cardiac outcomes  ascot ascot, studies, participants, age,  women, caucasians, africans, south asians,  atorvastatin, calcium daily, placebo,  tolerability, group,  atorvastatin, calcium, group,  placebo, median,  follow-up, collaborative, atorvastatin, studies, subjects age, range,  women, caucasians, south asians, afro-caribbean, type diabetes,  atorvastatin, calcium daily, placebo, frequency, treatment groups, follow-up,   rhabdomyolysis, treating, study, studies, subjects age, range,  women, caucasians, blacks, asians, clinically, chd,  atorvastatin, calcium daily, atorvastatin, calcium daily, discontinuations, high-dose, atorvastatin, group, low-dose group, median, follow-up,  persistent, transaminase, elevations, days, individuals, atorvastatin, individuals, atorvastatin, elevations, high-dose, atorvastatin, treatment group, low-dose, atorvastatin, group, decrease, endpoints, aggressive, studies, subjects age, range,  women, caucasians, asians, blacks,  atorvastatin, calcium, day, simvastatin, daily, frequency, treatment groups, follow-up,  stroke, prevention, cholesterol levels sparcl, sparcl, subjects age, range,  women, caucasians, blacks, asians, clinically, chd stroke, transient, ischemic attack tia,  atorvastatin, calcium, placebo, median, follow-up,  persistent, hepatic transaminase, days, atorvastatin, group, placebo, elevations, higher, atorvastatin, group, compared, placebo, diabetes reaction,  atorvastatin, group  placebo group, post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin, calcium,  ischemic stroke,  hemorrhagic stroke, placebo,  fatal, hemorrhagic stroke, groups, atorvastatin, calcium, placebo,  non-fatal, hemorrhagic strokes, atorvastatin, group, non-fatal, hemorrhagic strokes, placebo, non-fatal, hemorrhagic strokes,  study, hemorrhagic stroke, risk hemorrhagic stroke, atorvastatin, calcium, placebo, treatment groups, all-cause, mortality, atorvastatin, calcium day, group, placebo, proportions,  cardiovascular death, atorvastatin, calcium group, placebo group, proportions,  non-cardiovascular death, atorvastatin, calcium group, placebo group, studies, atorvastatin, calcium pediatric, study, boys postmenarchal, girls, hefh, ages,  female, caucasians, blacks, asians,  tolerability, atorvastatin, calcium daily, adjunct, diet, total cholesterol ldl-c, apo b, placebo, populations, studies, postmarketing, post-approval, atorvastatin, calcium tablets, voluntarily   estimate, frequency, relationship, drug exposure, atorvastatin, calcium therapy, market, introduction, causality assessment, anaphylaxis angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes, erythema multiforme, stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic, epidermal necrolysis, rhabdomyolysis, myositis, fatigue tendon rupture, fatal, non-fatal, hepatic failure, dizziness depression, peripheral neuropathy pancreatitis, interstitial lung disease, reports, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, statin, postmarketing, cognitive impairment, memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, statin, cognitive issues, statins, reports, nonserious reversible, statin, discontinuation, symptom, day,  symptom, resolution"
8305b5d8-53b3-475a-b263-07d5fd81392a,ADVERSE EVENTS Clinical Trials - Cefdinir Capsules (Adult and Adolescent Patients) In clinical trials 5093 adult and adolescent patients (3841 U.S. and 1252 non-U.S.) were treated with the recommended dose of cefdinir capsules (600 mg/day). Most adverse events were mild and self-limiting. No deaths or permanent disabilities were attributed to cefdinir. One hundred forty-seven of 5093 (3%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly probably or definitely associated with cefdinir therapy. The discontinuations were primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances usually diarrhea or nausea. Nineteen of 5093 (0.4%) patients were discontinued due to rash thought related to cefdinir administration. In the U.S. the following adverse events were thought by investigators to be possibly probably or definitely related to cefdinir capsules in multiple-dose clinical trials (N = 3841 cefdinir-treated patients): The following laboratory value changes of possible clinical significance irrespective of relationship to therapy with cefdinir were seen during clinical trials conducted in the U.S.: Clinical Trials - Cefdinir for Oral Suspension (Pediatric Patients) In clinical trials 2289 pediatric patients (1783 U.S. and 506 non-U.S.) were treated with the recommended dose of cefdinir suspension (14 mg/kg/day). Most adverse events were mild and self-limiting. No deaths or permanent disabilities were attributed to cefdinir. Forty of 2289 (2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events considered by the investigators to be possibly probably or definitely associated with cefdinir therapy. Discontinuations were primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances usually diarrhea. Five of 2289 (0.2%) patients were discontinued due to rash thought related to cefdinir administration. In the U.S. the following adverse events were thought by investigators to be possibly probably or definitely related to cefdinir suspension in multiple-dose clinical trials (N = 1783 cefdinir-treated patients): NOTE: In both cefdinir- and control-treated patients rates of diarrhea and rash were higher in the youngest pediatric patients. The incidence of diarrhea in cefdinir-treated patients <2 years of age was 17% (95/557) compared with 4% (51/1226) in those >>2 years old. The incidence of rash (primarily diaper rash in the younger patients) was 8% (43/557) in patients <2 years of age compared with 1% (8/1226) in those >>2 years old. The following laboratory value changes of possible clinical significance irrespective of relationship to therapy with cefdinir were seen during clinical trials conducted in the U.S.: Postmarketing Experience The following adverse experiences and altered laboratory tests regardless of their relationship to cefdinir have been reported during extensive postmarketing experience beginning with approval in Japan in 1991: shock anaphylaxis with rare cases of fatality facial and laryngeal edema feeling of suffocation serum sickness-like reactions conjunctivitis stomatitis Stevens-Johnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis exfoliative dermatitis erythema multiforme erythema nodosum acute hepatitis cholestasis fulminant hepatitis hepatic failure jaundice increased amylase acute enterocolitis bloody diarrhea hemorrhagic colitis melena pseudomembranous colitis pancytopenia granulocytopenia leukopenia thrombocytopenia idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura hemolytic anemia acute respiratory failure asthmatic attack drug- induced pneumonia eosinophilic pneumonia idiopathic interstitial pneumonia fever acute renal failure nephropathy bleeding tendency coagulation disorder disseminated intravascular coagulation upper GI bleed peptic ulcer ileus loss of consciousness allergic vasculitis possible cefdinir-diclofenac interaction cardiac failure chest pain myocardial infarction hypertension involuntary movements and rhabdomyolysis.

86d2cf6e-5ffc-2f68-e053-2991aa0ad403,Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines including CNS effects and respiratory depression are dose dependent with more severe effects occurring with high doses. In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%) followed by dizziness (6.9%) weakness (4.2%) and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines including lorazepam are fatigue drowsiness amnesia memory impairment confusion disorientation depression unmasking of depression disinhibition euphoria suicidal ideation/attempt ataxia asthenia extrapyramidal symptoms convulsions/seizures tremor vertigo eye-function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision) dysarthria slurred speech change in libido impotence decreased orgasm> headache coma> respiratory depression apnea worsening of sleep apnea worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease> gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea change in appetite constipation jaundice increase in bilirubin increase in liver transaminases increase in alkaline phosphatase> hypersensitivity reactions anaphylactic/oid reactions> dermatological symptoms allergic skin reactions alopecia> SIADH hyponatremia thrombocytopenia agranulocytosis pancytopenia> hypothermia> and autonomic manifestations. Paradoxical reactions including anxiety excitation agitation hostility aggression rage sleep disturbances/insomnia sexual arousal and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam.

Rare cases of discrete purpuric or petechial reactions at the application site have been reported. Rare cases of hyperpigmentation following the use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream have been reported. The relationship to lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the underlying procedure has not been established. In clinical studies on intact skin involving over 1300 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated subjects one or more such local reactions were noted in 56% of patients and were generally mild and transient resolving spontaneously within 1 or 2 hours. There were no serious reactions that were ascribed to lidocaine and prilocaine cream. Two recent reports describe blistering on the foreskin in neonates about to undergo circumcision. Both neonates received 1.0 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream. In patients treated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin local effects observed in the trials included: paleness (pallor or blanching) 37% redness (erythema) 30% alterations in temperature sensations 7% edema 6% itching 2% and rash less than 1%. In clinical studies on genital mucous membranes involving 378 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated patients one or more application site reactions usually mild and transient were noted in 41% of patients. The most common application site reactions were redness (21%) burning sensation (17%) and edema (10%). Allergic Reactions: Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or prilocaine can occur. They are characterized by urticaria angioedema bronchospasm and shock. If they occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Systemic (Dose Related) Reactions: Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed (see Pharmacokinetics subsection of CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and/or prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness nervousness apprehension euphoria confusion dizziness drowsiness tinnitus blurred or double vision vomiting sensations of heat cold or numbness twitching tremors convulsions unconsciousness respiratory depression and arrest).

4c1c1685-9b7a-49a5-9ae3-2ee3e59e1731,Adverse Reactions: Reports of adverse reactions associated with oxytetracycline administration include injection site swelling restlessness ataxia trembling swelling of eyelids ears muzzle anus and vulva (or scrotum and sheath in males) respiratory abnormalities (labored breathing) frothing at the mouth collapse and possibly death. Some of these reactions may be attributed either to anaphylaxis (an allergic reaction) or to cardiovascular collapse of unknown cause. Storage: Store at controlled room temperature 15-25C (59-77F). Exposure to colder temperatures may cause cloudiness. Gently warm the product to restore clarity. Use within 12 months of first puncture. Handle aseptically. Care of Sick Animals: The use of antibiotics in the management of diseases is based on an accurate diagnosis and an adequate course of treatment. When properly used in the treatment of diseases caused by oxytetracycline susceptible organisms most animals that have been treated with oxytetracycline injection show a noticeable improvement within 24 to 48 hours. It is recommended that the diagnosis and treatment of animal diseases be carried out by a veterinarian. Since many diseases look alike but require different types of treatment the use of professional veterinary and laboratory services can reduce treatment time costs and needless losses. Good housing sanitation and nutrition are important in the maintenance of healthy animals and are essential in the treatment of diseased animals. Indications: BIO-MYCIN 200 is intended for use in the treatment of the following diseases in beef cattle dairy cattle and swine when due to oxytetracycline-susceptible organisms: Cattle: In cattle BIO-MYCIN 200 is indicated in the treatment of pneumonia and shipping fever complex associated with Pasteurella spp. and Haemophilus spp.> infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye) caused by Moraxella bovis > foot-rot and diphtheria caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum > bacterial enteritis (scours) caused by Escherichia coli > wooden tongue caused by Actinobacillus lignieresii > leptospirosis caused by Leptospira pomona > and wound infections and acute metritis caused by strains of staphylococci and streptococci organisms sensitive to oxytetracycline.

82b83653-a097-464d-8265-672aba502aa8,ADVERSE REACTIONS Data upon which the following estimates of incidence of adverse reactions are made are derived from experiences reported in the literature unpublished clinical trials and voluntary reports since marketing of allopurinol began. Past experience suggested that the most frequent event following the initiation of allopurinol treatment was an increase in acute attacks of gout (average 6% in early studies). An analysis of current usage suggests that the incidence of acute gouty attacks has diminished to less than 1%. The explanation for this decrease has not been determined but may be due in part to initiating therapy more gradually (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The most frequent adverse reaction to allopurinol is skin rash. Skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal. Therefore treatment with allopurinol should be discontinued immediately if a rash develops (see WARNINGS ). Some patients with the most severe reaction also had fever chills arthralgias cholestatic jaundice eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis or leukopenia. Among 55 patients with gout treated with allopurinol for 3 to 34 months (average greater than 1 year) and followed prospectively Rundles observed that 3% of patients developed a type of drug reaction which was predominantly a pruritic maculopapular skin eruption sometimes scaly or exfoliative. However with current usage skin reactions have been observed less frequently than 1%. The explanation for this decrease is not obvious. The incidence of skin rash may be increased in the presence of renal insufficiency. The frequency of skin rash among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol has been reported to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS ). tttDrug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome or drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) has been reported in association with allopurinol use. The syndrome includes many of the severe reactions described above and is potentially life-threatening and fatal. The syndrome is often characterized by fever severe and profuse skin rash elevated leukocyte counts and in particular elevated eosinophil counts lymphadenopathy and multi-organ pathologies. Systemic symptoms often included but were not limited to the hepatic and renal systems. Symptoms involving the cardiac gastrointestinal lymphatic pulmonary and ophthalmic systems were also reported as occurring as part of the syndrome. It has been reported that symptoms may develop in approximately 1 week from initiating allopurinol therapy but longer latency periods have also been reported.,"     voluntary reports, marketing allopurinol, frequent, event, initiation, allopurinol, treatment, increase, acute attacks gout, analysis, usage,  acute gouty attacks, decrease, therapy, dosage, administration, frequent, reaction, allopurinol, skin rash, skin, fatal, treatment, allopurinol, discontinued, rash, develops, severe, reaction, fever chills arthralgias, cholestatic jaundice, leukocytosis, leukopenia, gout,  allopurinol, months,  rundles, type drug reaction, pruritic maculopapular, skin eruption, scaly exfoliative, usage, skin, decrease,  skin rash, renal insufficiency, frequency, skin rash, ampicillin, amoxicillin, allopurinol, tttdrug rash, eosinophilia, systemic, symptoms, dress syndrome, drug hypersensitivity syndrome, association, allopurinol, syndrome, severe, life-threatening, fatal, syndrome, fever, severe, profuse, skin rash, elevated, leukocyte, elevated, eosinophil, multi-organ pathologies, systemic symptoms, hepatic renal systems, symptoms, cardiac gastrointestinal lymphatic pulmonary ophthalmic systems, part syndrome, symptoms, week, allopurinol therapy, longer, latency"

d2c7f045-e70c-4e2b-b2e0-d81a271d0a04,"ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring with ibuprofen tablets is gastrointestinal. In controlled clinical trials the percentage of patients reporting one or more gastrointestinal complaints ranged from 4% to 16%. In controlled studies when ibuprofen tablets were compared to aspirin and indomethacin in equally effective doses the overall incidence of gastrointestinal complaints was about half that seen in either the aspirin or indomethacin-treated patients. Adverse reactions observed during controlled clinical trials at an incidence greater than 1% are listed in the table. Those reactions listed in Column one encompass observations in approximately 3000 patients. More than 500 of these patients were treated for periods of at least 54 weeks. Still other reactions occurring less frequently than 1 in 100 were reported in controlled clinical trials and from marketing experience. These reactions have been divided into two categories: Column two of the table lists reactions with therapy with ibuprofen tablets where the probability of a causal relationship exists: for the reactions in Column three a causal relationship with ibuprofen tablets has not been established. Reported side effects were higher at doses of 3200 mg/day than at doses of 2400 mg or less per day in clinical trials of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

196f706b-7234-4c53-ada2-93c4df02f178,ADVERSE REACTIONS In the double-blind controlled phase of the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study 2046 patients received gemfibrozil for up to five years. In that study the following adverse reactions were statistically more frequent in subjects in the gemfibrozil group: Gallbladder surgery was performed in 0.9% of gemfibrozil and 0.5% of placebo subjects in the primary prevention component a 64% excess which is not statistically different from the excess of gallbladder surgery observed in the clofibrate group compared to the placebo group of the WHO study. Gallbladder surgery was also performed more frequently in the gemfibrozil group compared to the placebo group (1.9% versus 0.3% p=0.07) in the secondary prevention component. A statistically significant increase in appendectomy in the gemfibrozil group was seen also in the secondary prevention component (6 on gemfibrozil versus 0 on placebo p=0.014). Nervous system and special senses adverse reactions were more common in the gemfibrozil group. These included hypesthesia paresthesias and taste perversion. Other adverse reactions that were more common among gemfibrozil treatment group subjects but where a causal relationship was not established include cataracts peripheral vascular disease and intracerebral hemorrhage. From other studies it seems probable that gemfibrozil is causally related to the occurrence of MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS (see WARNINGS ) and to ABNORMAL LIVER FUNCTION TESTS and HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES (see PRECAUTIONS ). Reports of viral and bacterial infections (common cold cough urinary tract infections) were more common in gemfibrozil treated patients in other controlled clinical trials of 805 patients. Additional adverse reactions that have been reported for gemfibrozil are listed below by system. These are categorized according to whether a causal relationship to treatment with gemfibrozil is probable or not established: Additional adverse reactions that have been reported include cholecystitis and cholelithiasis ( see WARNI,"double-blind phase, primary prevention, helsinki heart study, gemfibrozil,   gemfibrozil, group, gallbladder surgery, gemfibrozil, placebo  primary prevention, statistically, excess, gallbladder surgery, clofibrate group, compared, placebo group study, gallbladder surgery, gemfibrozil, group, compared, placebo group, secondary prevention, statistically significant, increase, appendectomy, gemfibrozil, group, secondary prevention, gemfibrozil, placebo, nervous system, gemfibrozil, group, hypesthesia paresthesias, taste perversion, gemfibrozil, treatment, group  relationship, cataracts, peripheral vascular disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, studies, gemfibrozil, occurrence, musculoskeletal symptoms, abnormal, liver function, hematologic changes, reports, viral, cold cough, urinary tract, gemfibrozil,   gemfibrozil, system, categorized, relationship, treatment, gemfibrozil, cholecystitis cholelithiasis"
275a2c51-9679-4f42-b8cc-21b04369a056,Adverse Reactions Control of Atopic Dermatitis In a masked field study to assess the effectiveness and safety of oclacitinib for the control of atopic dermatitis in dogs 152 dogs treated with APOQUEL and 147 dogs treated with placebo (vehicle control) were evaluated for safety. The majority of dogs in the placebo group withdrew from the 112-day study by Day 16. Adverse reactions reported (and percent of dogs affected) during Days 0-16 included diarrhea (4.6% APOQUEL 3.4% placebo) vomiting (3.9% APOQUEL 4.1% placebo) anorexia (2.6% APOQUEL 0% placebo) new cutaneous or subcutaneous lump (2.6% APOQUEL 2.7% placebo) and lethargy (2.0% APOQUEL 1.4% placebo). In most cases diarrhea vomiting anorexia and lethargy spontaneously resolved with continued dosing. Dogs on APOQUEL had decreased leukocytes (neutrophil eosinophil and monocyte counts) and serum globulin and increased cholesterol and lipase compared to the placebo group but group means remained within the normal range. Mean lymphocyte counts were transiently increased at Day 14 in the APOQUEL group. Dogs that withdrew from the masked field study could enter an unmasked study where all dogs received APOQUEL. Between the masked and unmasked study 283 dogs received at least one dose of APOQUEL. Of these 283 dogs two dogs were withdrawn from study due to suspected treatment-related adverse reactions: one dog that had an intense flare-up of dermatitis and severe secondary pyoderma after 19 days of APOQUEL administration and one dog that developed generalized demodicosis after 28 days of APOQUEL administration. Two other dogs on APOQUEL were withdrawn from study due to suspected or confirmed malignant neoplasia and subsequently euthanized including one dog that developed signs associated with a heart base mass after 21 days of APOQUEL administration and one dog that developed a Grade III mast cell tumor after 60 days of APOQUEL administration. One of the 147 dogs in the placebo group developed a Grade I mast cell tumor and was withdrawn from the masked study. Additional dogs receiving APOQUEL were hospitalized for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia (one dog) transient bloody vomiting and stool (one dog) and cystitis with urolithiasis (one dog). In the 283 dogs that received APOQUEL the following additional clinical signs were reported after beginning APOQUEL (percentage of dogs with at least one report of the clinical sign as a non-pre-existing finding): pyoderma (12.0%) non-specified dermal lumps (12.0%) otitis (9.9%) vomiting (9.2%) diarrhea (6.0%) histiocytoma (3.9%) cystitis (3.5%) anorexia (3.2%) lethargy (2.8%) yeast skin infections (2.5%) pododermatitis (2.5%) lipoma (2.1%) polydipsia (1.4%) lymphadenopathy (1.1%) nausea (1.1%) increased appetite (1.1%) aggression (1.1%) and weight loss (0.7). Control of Pruritus Associated with Allergic Dermatitis In a masked field study to assess the effectiveness and safety of oclacitinib for the control of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis in dogs 216 dogs treated with APOQUEL and 220 dogs treated with placebo (vehicle control) were evaluated for safety. During the 30-day study there were no fatalities and no adverse reactions requiring hospital care. Adverse reactions reported (and percent of dogs affected) during Days 0-7 included diarrhea (2.3% APOQUEL 0.9% placebo) vomiting (2.3% APOQUEL 1.8% placebo) lethargy (1.8% APOQUEL 1.4% placebo) anorexia (1.4% APOQUEL 0% placebo) and polydipsia (1.4% APOQUEL 0% placebo). In most of these cases signs spontaneously resolved with continued dosing. Five APOQUEL group dogs were withdrawn from study because of: darkening areas of skin and fur (1 dog)> diarrhea (1 dog)> fever lethargy and cystitis (1 dog)> an inflamed footpad and vomiting (1 dog)> and diarrhea vomiting and lethargy (1 dog). Dogs in the APOQUEL group had a slight decrease in mean white blood cell counts (neutrophil eosinophil and monocyte counts) that remained within the normal reference range. Mean lymphocyte count for dogs in the APOQUEL group increased at Day 7 but returned to pretreatment levels by study end without a break in APOQUEL administration. Serum cholesterol increased in 25% of APOQUEL group dogs but mean cholesterol remained within the reference range. Continuation Field Study After completing APOQUEL field studies 239 dogs enrolled in an unmasked (no placebo control) continuation therapy study receiving APOQUEL for an unrestricted period of time. Mean time on this study was 372 days (range 1 to 610 days). Of these 239 dogs one dog developed demodicosis following 273 days of APOQUEL administration. One dog developed dermal pigmented viral plaques following 266 days of APOQUEL administration. One dog developed a moderately severe bronchopneumonia after 272 days of APOQUEL administration> this infection resolved with antimicrobial treatment and temporary discontinuation of APOQUEL. One dog was euthanized after developing abdominal ascites and pleural effusion of unknown etiology after 450 days of APOQUEL administration. Six dogs were euthanized because of suspected malignant neoplasms: including thoracic metastatic abdominal metastatic splenic frontal sinus and intracranial neoplasms and transitional cell carcinoma after 17 120 175 49 141 and 286 days of APOQUEL administration respectively. Two dogs each developed a Grade II mast cell tumor after 52 and 91 days of APOQUEL administration respectively. One dog developed low grade B-cell lymphoma after 392 days of APOQUEL administration. Two dogs each developed an apocrine gland adenocarcinoma (one dermal one anal sac) after approximately 210 and 320 days of APOQUEL administration respectively. One dog developed a low grade oral spindle cell sarcoma after 320 days of APOQUEL administration.

097424ef-612f-4bc2-809a-e5bb8eeae244,ADVERSE REACTIONS In U.S. and foreign controlled studies the frequency of serious adverse reactions reported was very low. Of 702 patients 11.8% reported adverse reactions and in only 1.5% was glipizide discontinued. Hypoglycemia See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE sections. Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal disturbances are the most common reactions. Gastrointestinal complaints were reported with the following approximate incidence: nausea and diarrhea one in seventy> constipation and gastralgia one in one hundred. They appear to be dose-related and may disappear on division or reduction of dosage. Cholestatic jaundice may occur rarely with sulfonylureas: glipizide should be discontinued if this occurs. Dermatologic Allergic skin reactions including erythema morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions urticaria pruritus and eczema have been reported in about one in seventy patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of glipizide> if skin reactions persist the drug should be discontinued. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic Leukopenia agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia hemolytic anemia (see PRECAUTIONS ) aplastic anemia and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. In the mouse glipizide pretreatment did not cause an accumulation of acetaldehyde after ethanol administration. Clinical experience to date has shown that glipizide has an extremely low incidence of disulfiram-like alcohol reactions. Endocrine Reactions Cases of hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion have been reported with this and other sulfonylureas. Miscellaneous Dizziness drowsiness and headache have each been reported in about one in fifty patients treated with glipizide. They are usually transient and seldom require discontinuance of therapy. Laboratory Tests The pattern of laboratory test abnormalities observed with glipizide was similar to that for other sulfonylureas. Occasional mild to moderate elevations of SGOT LDH alkaline phosphatase BUN and creatinine were noted. One case of jaundice was reported. The relationship of these abnormalities to glipizide is uncertain and they have rarely been associated with clinical symptoms.

Death coma and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone in postoperative patients may result in significant reversal of analgesia and may cause agitation (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION> Usage in Adults-Postoperative Opioid Depression ). Opioid Depression Abrupt reversal of opioid depression may result in nausea vomiting sweating tachycardia increased blood pressure tremulousness seizures ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation pulmonary edema and cardiac arrest which may result in death (see PRECAUTIONS ). Opioid Dependence Abrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who are physically dependent on opioids may precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome which may include but not limited to the following signs and symptoms: body aches fever sweating runny nose sneezing piloerection yawning weakness shivering or trembling nervousness restlessness or irritability diarrhea nausea or vomiting abdominal cramps increased blood pressure and tachycardia. In the neonate opioid withdrawal may also include: convulsions excessive crying and hyperactive reflexes (See WARNINGS ).

a668d223-47a3-46b7-b642-f2de0dca6ab5,"Adverse Reactions: In a well-controlled US field study which included a total of 333 households and 615 treated dogs (415 administered afoxolaner> 200 administered active control) no serious adverse reactions were observed with NexGard. Over the 90-day study period all observations of potential adverse reactions were recorded. The most frequent reactions reported at an incidence of >> 1% within any of the three months of observations are presented in the following table. The most frequently reported adverse reaction was vomiting. The occurrence of vomiting was generally self-limiting and of short duration and tended to decrease with subsequent doses in both groups. Five treated dogs experienced anorexia during the study and two of those dogs experienced anorexia with the first dose but not subsequent doses. In the US field study one dog with a history of seizures experienced a seizure on the same day after receiving the first dose and on the same day after receiving the second dose of NexGard. This dog experienced a third seizure one week after receiving the third dose. The dog remained enrolled and completed the study.

df4b6775-4337-41e0-815a-b064d98c3fe1,ADVERSE REACTIONS QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride (see PRECAUTIONS and Drug Interactions ) . Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Over 3700 patients have received granisetron hydrochloride tablets in clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies consisting primarily of cyclophosphamide or cisplatin regimens. In patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets 1 mg bid for 1 7 or 14 days or 2 mg daily for 1 day adverse experiences reported in more than 5% of the patients with comparator and placebo incidences are listed in Table 4 . Other adverse events reported in clinical trials were: Gastrointestinal: In single-day dosing studies in which adverse events were collected for 7 days nausea (20%) and vomiting (12%) were recorded as adverse events after the 24 hour efficacy assessment period. Hepatic: In comparative trials elevation of AST and ALT (>> 2 times the upper limit of normal) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets occurred in 5% and 6% of patients respectively. These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators (AST: 2%> ALT: 9%). Cardiovascular: Hypertension (1%)> hypotension angina pectoris atrial fibrillation and syncope have been observed rarely. Central Nervous System: Dizziness (5%) insomnia (5%) anxiety (2%) somnolence (1%). One case compatible with but not diagnostic of extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported in a patient treated with granisetron hydrochloride tablets. Hypersensitivity: Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions sometimes severe (e.g. anaphylaxis shortness of breath hypotension urticaria) have been reported. Other: Fever (5%). Events often associated with chemotherapy also have been reported: leukopenia (9%) decreased appetite (6%) anemia (4%) alopecia (3%) thrombocytopenia (2%). Over 5000 patients have received injectable granisetron hydrochloride in clinical trials. Table 5 gives the comparative frequencies of the five commonly reported adverse events (> 3%) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride injection 40 mcg/kg in single-day chemotherapy trials. These patients received chemotherapy primarily cisplatin and intravenous fluids during the 24 hour period following granisetron hydrochloride injection administration. In the absence of a placebo group there is uncertainty as to how many of these events should be attributed to granisetron hydrochloride except for headache which was clearly more frequent than in comparison groups. Radiation-Induced Nausea and Vomiting In controlled clinical trials the adverse events reported by patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets and concurrent radiation were similar to those reported by patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets prior to chemotherapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea asthenia and constipation. Headache however was less prevalent in this patient population.

2cb1bebe-0ced-46d8-bf21-c28a9acc4a15,[' When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination also refer to the Adverse Reactions section of the package insert for olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride capsules. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Adults The information below for olanzapine is derived from a clinical trial database for olanzapine consisting of 10504 adult patients with approximately 4765 patient-years of exposure to olanzapine. This database includes: (1) 2500 patients who participated in multiple-dose oral olanzapine premarketing trials in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease representing approximately 1122 patient-years of exposure as of February 14 1995> (2) 182 patients who participated in oral olanzapine premarketing bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials representing approximately 66 patient-years of exposure> (3) 191 patients who participated in an oral olanzapine trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimer's disease representing approximately 29 patient-years of exposure> (4) 5788 additional patients from 88 oral olanzapine clinical trials as of December 31 2001> (5) 1843 additional patients from 41 olanzapine clinical trials as of October 31 2011. Also included below is information from the premarketing 6-week clinical study database for olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate consisting of 224 patients who participated in bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) trials with approximately 22 patient-years of exposure. The conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies inpatients and outpatients fixed-dose and dose-titration studies and short-term or longer-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions results of physical examinations vital signs weights laboratory analytes ECGs chest x-rays and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Certain portions of the discussion below relating to objective or numeric safety parameters namely dose-dependent adverse reactions vital sign changes weight gain laboratory changes and ECG changes are derived from studies in patients with schizophrenia and have not been duplicated for bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) or agitation. However this information is also generally applicable to bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) and agitation. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained by spontaneous report and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized reaction categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow MedDRA and COSTART Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. The reported reactions do not include those reaction terms that were so general as to be uninformative. Reactions listed elsewhere in labeling may not be repeated below. It is important to emphasize that although the reactions occurred during treatment with olanzapine they were not necessarily caused by it. The entire label should be read to gain a complete understanding of the safety profile of olanzapine. The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing healthcare provider with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse reactions incidence in the population studied. Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled and Combination Trials The following findings are based on premarketing trials of oral olanzapine for schizophrenia bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) a subsequent trial of patients having various psychiatric symptoms in association with Alzheimer's disease and premarketing combination trials. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials Schizophrenia - Overall there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (5% for oral olanzapine vs 6% for placebo). However discontinuations due to increases in ALT were considered to be drug related (2% for oral olanzapine vs 0% for placebo). Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Monotherapy - Overall there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (2% for oral olanzapine vs 2% for placebo). Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term Combination Trials Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Olanzapine as Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate - In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 11% for the combination of oral olanzapine with lithium or valproate compared to 2% for patients who remained on lithium or valproate monotherapy. Discontinuations with the combination of oral olanzapine and lithium or valproate that occurred in more than 1 patient were: somnolence (3%) weight gain (1%) and peripheral edema (1%). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of oral olanzapine (incidence of 5% or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients (olanzapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were: ' ' Table 9: Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Associated with theUse of Oral Olanzapine in 6-Week Trials - SCHIZOPHRENIA a Personality disorder is the COSTART term for designating nonaggressive objectionable behavior.

Other Adverse Reactions Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Oral Olanzapine Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by patients treated with oral olanzapine (at multiple doses >1 mg/day) in clinical trials. This listing is not intended to include reactions (1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling (2) for which a drug cause was remote (3) which were so general as to be uninformative (4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications or (5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Reactions are classified by body system using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole - Infrequent: chills face edema photosensitivity reaction suicide attempt 1 > Rare: chills and fever hangover effect sudden death 1 . Cardiovascular System - Infrequent: cerebrovascular accident vasodilatation. Digestive System - Infrequent: abdominal distension nausea and vomiting tongue edema> Rare: ileus intestinal obstruction liver fatty deposit.

Laboratory Changes Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adults: An assessment of the premarketing experience for olanzapine revealed an association with asymptomatic increases in ALT AST and GGT. Within the original premarketing database of about 2400 adult patients with baseline ALT <90 IU/L the incidence of ALT elevations to >>200 IU/L was 2% (50/2381). None of these patients experienced jaundice or other symptoms attributable to liver impairment and most had transient changes that tended to normalize while olanzapine treatment was continued. In placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adults clinically significant ALT elevations (change from <>3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] at baseline to >3 times ULN) were observed in 5% (77/1426) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 1% (10/1187) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations >5 times ULN were observed in 2% (29/1438) of olanzapine-treated patients compared to 0.3% (4/1196) of placebo-treated patients. ALT values returned to normal or were decreasing at last follow-up in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice liver failure or met the criteria for Hy's Rule. From an analysis of the laboratory data in an integrated database of 41 completed clinical studies in adult patients treated with oral olanzapine high GGT levels were recorded in >1% (88/5245) of patients. Caution should be exercised in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Olanzapine administration was also associated with increases in serum prolactin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)] with an asymptomatic elevation of the eosinophil count in 0.3% of patients and with an increase in CPK. From an analysis of the laboratory data in an integrated database of 41 completed clinical studies in adult patients treated with oral olanzapine elevated uric acid was recorded in >3% (171/4641) of patients. Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents: In placebo-controlled clinical trials of adolescent patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) greater frequencies for the following treatment-emergent findings at anytime were observed in laboratory analytes compared to placebo: elevated ALT (>3X ULN in patients with ALT at baseline <>3X ULN) (12% vs 2%)> elevated AST (28% vs 4%)> low total bilirubin (22% vs 7%)> elevated GGT (10% vs 1%)> and elevated prolactin (47% vs 7%). In placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescents clinically significant ALT elevations (change from <>3 times ULN at baseline to >3 times ULN) were observed in 12% (22/192) of patients exposed to olanzapine compared to 2% (2/109) of patients exposed to placebo. ALT elevations >5 times ULN were observed in 4% (8/192) of olanzapine-treated patients compared to 1% (1/109) of placebo-treated patients. ALT values returned to normal or were decreasing at last follow-up in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine or discontinued olanzapine. No adolescent patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice liver failure or met the criteria for Hy's Rule. ECG Changes - In pooled studies of adults as well as pooled studies of adolescents there were no significant differences between olanzapine and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters including QT QTc (Fridericia corrected) and PR intervals. Olanzapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo (adults: +2.4 beats per minute vs no change with placebo> adolescents: +6.3 beats per minute vs -5.1 beats per minute with placebo). This increase in heart rate may be related to olanzapine's potential for inducing orthostatic changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of olanzapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to olanzapine therapy include the following: allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylactoid reaction angioedema pruritus or urticaria) cholestatic or mixed liver injury diabetic coma diabetic ketoacidosis discontinuation reaction (diaphoresis nausea or vomiting) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) hepatitis jaundice neutropenia pancreatitis priapism rash restless legs syndrome rhabdomyolysis salivary hypersecretion stuttering 1 and venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis). Random cholesterol levels of >240 mg/dL and random triglyceride levels of >1000 mg/dL have been reported. 1 Stuttering was only studied in oral formulations. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The risks of using olanzapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Olanzapine Diazepam - The co-administration of diazepam with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Cimetidine and Antacids - Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine. Inducers of CYP1A2 - Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50% increase in the clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance. Alcohol - Ethanol (45 mg/70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The co-administration of alcohol (i.e. ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Inhibitors of CYP1A2 Fluvoxamine: Fluvoxamine a CYP1A2 inhibitor decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine C max following fluvoxamine of 54% in female nonsmokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52% and 108% respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16%) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for olanzapine and fluoxetine hydrochloride capsules. Warfarin - Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Inducers of CYP1A2 or Glucuronyl Transferase - Omeprazole and rifampin may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance. Charcoal - The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the C max and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60%. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose. Anticholinergic Drugs - Concomitant treatment with olanzapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Olanzapine should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . 7.2 Potential for Olanzapine to Affect Other Drugs CNS Acting Drugs - Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Antihypertensive Agents - Olanzapine because of its potential for inducing hypotension may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents. Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists - Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Lithium - Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)] . Valproate - Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)] . Effect of Olanzapine on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes - In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2 CYP2C9 CYP2C19 CYP2D6 and CYP3A. Thus olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes. Imipramine - Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite desipramine. Warfarin - Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Diazepam - Olanzapine did not influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam or its active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam. However diazepam co-administered with olanzapine increased the orthostatic hypotension observed with either drug given alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Alcohol - Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of ethanol [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Biperiden - Multiple doses of olanzapine did not influence the kinetics of biperiden. Theophylline - Multiple doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline or its metabolites. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination

23b6d4a3-b273-4e10-9da9-1376933fdbdf,ADVERSE REACTIONS Body as a Whole The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a systemic reaction that may occur after the initiation of penicillin therapy in patients with syphilis or other spirochetal infections (i.e. Lyme disease and Relapsing fever). The reaction begins one to two hours after initiation of therapy and disappears within 12 to 24 hours. It is characterized by fever chills myalgias headache exacerbation of cutaneous lesions tachycardia hyperventiliation vasodilation with flushing and mild hypotension. The pathogenesis of the Herxheimer reaction may be due to the release from the spirochaete of host stable pyrogen. Hypersensitivity Reactions The reported incidence of allergic reactions to all penicillins ranges from 0.7 to 10 percent in different studies (see WARNINGS ). Sensitization is usually the result of previous treatment with a penicillin but some individuals have had immediate reactions when first treated. In such cases it is postulated that prior exposure to penicillin may have occurred via trace amounts present in milk or vaccines. Two types of allergic reactions to penicillin are noted clinically - Immediate and delayed. Immediate reactions usually occur within 20 minutes of administration and range in severity from urticaria and pruritus to angloneurotic edema laryngospasm bronchospasm hypotension vascular collapse and death (see WARNINGS ). Such immediate anaphylactic reactions are very rare and usually occur after parenteral therapy but a few cases of anaphylaxis have been reported following oral therapy. Another type of immediate reaction an accelerated reaction may occur between 20 minutes and 45 hours after administration and may include urticaria pruritus fever and occasionally laryngeal edema. Delayed reactions to penicillin therapy usually occur within 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. Manifestations include serum sickness-like symptoms i.e. fever malaise urticaria myalgia arthralgia abdominal pain and various skin rashes ranging from maculopapular eruptions to exfoliative dermatitis. Contact dermatitis has been observed in individuals who prepare penicillin solutions. Gastrointestinal System Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with the onset occurring during or after penicillin G treatment. Nausea vomiting stomatitis black or hairy tongue and other symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation may occur especially during oral therapy. Hematologic System Reactions include neutropenia which resolves after penicillin therapy is discontinued> Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia an uncommon reaction occurs in patients treated with intravenous penicillin G in doses greater than 10 million units/day and who have previously received large doses of the drug> and with large doses of penicillin a bleeding diathesis can occur secondary to platelet dysfunction. Metabolic Penicillin G Sodium for injection USP (1 million units contains 1.68 mEq of sodium ion) may cause serious and even fatal electrolyte disturbances when given intravenously in large doses. Cardiovascular System High dosage of penicillin G sodium may result in congestive heart failure due to high sodium intake. Nervous System Neurotoxic reactions including hyperreflexia myoclonic twitches seizures and coma have been reported following the administration of massive intravenous doses and are more likely in patients with impaired renal function. Urogenital System Renal tubular damage and interstitial nephritis have been associated with large intravenous doses of penicillin G. Manifestations of this reaction may include fever rash eosinophilia proteinuria eosinophiluria hematuria and a rise in serum urea nitrogen. Discontinuation of penicillin G results in resolution in the majority of patients.

75799c61-f45f-46ab-9f5f-1d5f2a832d19,ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypoglycemia See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE Sections. Gastrointestinal Reactions Cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur rarely which may progress to liver failure> Glyburide should be discontinued if this occurs. Liver function abnormalities including isolated transaminase elevations have been reported. Gastrointestinal disturbances e.g. nausea epigastric fullness and heartburn are the most common reactions and occur in 1.8% of treated patients. They tend to be dose-related and may disappear when dosage is reduced. Dermatologic Reactions Allergic skin reactions e.g. pruritus erythema urticaria and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions occur in 1.5% of treated patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of Glyburide. Bullous reactions erythema multiforme and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported. If skin reactions persist the drug should be discontinued. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic Reactions Leukopenia agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia which occasionally may present as purpura hemolytic anemia aplastic anemia and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic Reactions Hepatic porphyria reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas> however these have not been reported with Glyburide. Disulfiram-like reactions have been reported very rarely with Glyburide. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported with glyburide and all other sulfonylureas most often in patients who are on other medications or have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion has been reported with certain other sulfonylureas and it has been suggested that these sulfonylureas may augment the peripheral (antidiuretic) action of ADH and/or increase release of ADH. Glyburide can cause weight gain. Other Reactions Changes in accommodation and/or blurred vision have been reported with glyburide and other sulfonylureas. These are thought to be related to fluctuation in glucose levels.

Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole patients should be specifically warned about these reactions and should be told to stop the drug and report immediately to their physicians if any neurologic symptoms occur. In addition patients have reported headache syncope dizziness vertigo incoordination ataxia confusion dysarthria irritability depression weakness and insomnia (see WARNINGS ). Gastrointestinal: The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract particularly nausea sometimes accompanied by headache anorexia and occasionally vomiting> diarrhea> epigastric distress> and abdominal cramping and constipation. Mouth : A sharp unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue glossitis and stomatitis have occurred> these may be associated with a sudden overgrowth of Candida which may occur during therapy. Dermatologic : Erythematous rash and pruritus. Hematopoietic : Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia)> rarely reversible thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular : Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Hypersensitivity : Urticaria erythematous rash Stevens-Johnson Syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis flushing nasal congestion dryness of the mouth (or vagina or vulva) and fever. Renal : Dysuria cystitis polyuria incontinence and a sense of pelvic pressure. Instances of darkened urine have been reported by approximately one patient in 100000. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance. Other : Proliferation of Candida in the vagina dyspareunia decrease of libido proctitis and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling ""serum sickness."" Rare cases of pancreatitis which generally abated on withdrawal of the drug have been reported. Patients with Crohn's disease are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers. There have been some reports in the medical literature of breast and colon cancer in Crohn's disease patients who have been treated with metronidazole at high doses for extended periods of time. A cause and effect relationship has not been established.

a731c436-a593-c148-e053-2995a90a8fbc,ADVERSE REACTIONS Fluconazole is generally well tolerated. In some patients particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer changes in renal and hematological function test results and hepatic abnormalities have been observed during treatment with fluconazole and comparative agents but the clinical significance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. In Patients Receiving a Single Dose for Vaginal Candidiasis: During comparative clinical studies conducted in the United States 448 patients with vaginal candidiasis were treated with fluconazole 150 mg single dose. The overall incidence of side effects possibly related to fluconazole was 26%. In 422 patients receiving active comparative agents the incidence was 16%. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported in the patients who received 150 mg single dose fluconazole for vaginitis were headache (13%) nausea (7%) and abdominal pain (6%). Other side effects reported with an incidence equal to or greater than 1% included diarrhea (3%) dyspepsia (1%) dizziness (1%) and taste perversion (1%). Most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Rarely angioedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported in marketing experience. In Patients Receiving Multiple Doses for Other Infections: Sixteen percent of over 4000 patients treated with fluconazole in clinical trials of 7 days or more experienced adverse events. Treatment was discontinued in 1.5% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.3% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities. Clinical adverse events were reported more frequently in HIV infected patients (21%) than in non-HIV infected patients (13%)> however the patterns in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients were similar. The proportions of patients discontinuing therapy due to clinical adverse events were similar in the two groups (1.5%). The following treatment-related clinical adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in 4048 patients receiving fluconazole for 7 or more days in clinical trials: nausea 3.7% headache 1.9% skin rash 1.8% vomiting 1.7% abdominal pain 1.7% and diarrhea 1.5%. Hepato-biliary: In combined clinical trials and marketing experience there have been rare cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with fluconazole. (See WARNINGS . ) The spectrum of these hepatic reactions has ranged from mild transient elevations in transaminases to clinical hepatitis cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure including fatalities. Instances of fatal hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly AIDS or malignancy) and often while taking multiple concomitant medications. Transient hepatic reactions including hepatitis and jaundice have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. In each of these cases liver function returned to baseline on discontinuation of fluconazole. In two comparative trials evaluating the efficacy of fluconazole for the suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis a statistically significant increase was observed in median AST (SGOT) levels from a baseline value of 30 IU/L to 41 IU/L in one trial and 34 IU/L to 66 IU/L in the other. The overall rate of serum transaminase elevations of more than 8 times the upper limit of normal was approximately 1% in fluconazole-treated patients in clinical trials. These elevations occurred in patients with severe underlying disease predominantly AIDS or malignancies most of whom were receiving multiple concomitant medications including many known to be hepatotoxic. The incidence of abnormally elevated serum transaminases was greater in patients taking fluconazole concomitantly with one or more of the following medications: rifampin phenytoin isoniazid valproic acid or oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents. Post-Marketing Experience In addition the following adverse events have occurred during post-marketing experience. Immunologic: In rare cases anaphylaxis (including angioedema face edema and pruritus) has been reported. Body as a Whole : Asthenia fatigue fever malaise. Cardiovascular: QT prolongation torsade de pointes. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Central Nervous System: Seizures dizziness. Hematopoietic and Lymphatic: Leukopenia including neutropenia and agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia. Metabolic: Hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia hypokalemia. Gastrointestinal : Cholestasis dry mouth hepatocellular damage dyspepsia vomiting. Other Senses: Taste perversion. Musculoskeletal System: myalgia.

Skin and Appendages : Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis drug eruption including fixed drug eruption increased sweating exfoliative skin disorders including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (see WARNINGS ) alopecia. Adverse Reactions in Children: The pattern and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities recorded during pediatric clinical trials are comparable to those seen in adults. In Phase II/III clinical trials conducted in the United States and in Europe 577 pediatric patients ages 1 day to 17 years were treated with fluconazole at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day for up to 1616 days. Thirteen percent of children experienced treatment-related adverse events. The most commonly reported events were vomiting (5%) abdominal pain (3%) nausea (2%) and diarrhea (2%). Treatment was discontinued in 2.3% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.4% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities.

Worldwide experience in over 1300 patients was similar. Adverse events reported in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials were generally mild and transient. Hypotension was the most commonly reported adverse event during clinical trials. Asymptomatic hypotension occurred in 4.3% of patients. Symptomatic hypotension occurred in 3.2% of patients. When treatment for hypotension was required it generally consisted of administration of saline or placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position. Other events reported in a least 1% of the diltiazem-treated patients were injection site reactions (e.g. itching burning) - 3.9% vasodilation (flushing) - 1.7% and arrhythmia (junctional rhythm or isorhythmic dissociation) - 1%.

99a0571d-2db3-4bc5-9c85-e70f48f15997,"ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular Effects In patients receiving milrinone in Phase II and III clinical trials ventricular arrhythmias were reported in 12.1%: Ventricular ectopic activity 8.5%> nonsustained ventricular tachycardia 2.8%> sustained ventricular tachycardia 1% and ventricular fibrillation 0.2% (2 patients experienced more than one type of arrhythmia). Holter recordings demonstrated that in some patients injection of milrinone increased ventricular ectopy including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Life-threatening arrhythmias were infrequent and when present have been associated with certain underlying factors such as preexisting arrhythmias metabolic abnormalities (e.g. hypokalemia) abnormal digoxin levels and catheter insertion. Milrinone was not shown to be arrhythmogenic in an electrophysiology study. Supraventricular arrhythmias were reported in 3.8% of the patients receiving milrinone. The incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias has not been related to the dose or plasma milrinone concentration. Other cardiovascular adverse reactions include hypotension 2.9% and angina/chest pain 1.2%. In the post marketing experience there have been rare cases of ""torsades de pointes"" reported.

e8ba012a-08a9-4f67-9f88-3284377e80be,ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic Adverse experiences following the administration of lidocaine HCl are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are in general dose- related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection or may result from a hypersensitivity idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: Central Nervous System CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness nervousness apprehension euphoria confusion dizziness drowsiness tinnitus blurred or double vision vomiting sensations of heat cold or numbness twitching tremors convulsions unconsciousness respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Drowsiness following the administration of lidocaine HCl is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular System Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia hypotension and cardiovascular collapse which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions urticaria edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in the multiple dose vials. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions may occur as result of sensitivity to lidocaine but are infrequent. If allergic reactions do occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. There have been no reports of cross sensitivity between lidocaine hydrochloride and procainamide or between lidocaine hydrochloride and quinidine. Neurologic The incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10440 patients who received lidocaine HCl for spinal anesthesia the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional headaches hypotension and backache> 2 percent for shivering> and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms nausea respiratory inadequacy and double vision. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic. In the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block) hypotension secondary to spinal block loss of bladder and bowel control and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures. There have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration.

b028fb3d-2939-4197-b31c-ac327f9593ec,ADVERSE REACTIONS Note: Some adverse effects of chlorpromazine may be more likely to occur or occur with greater intensity in patients with special medical problems e.g. patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses. Drowsiness Usually mild to moderate may occur particularly during the first or second week after which it generally disappears. If troublesome dosage may be lowered. Jaundice Overall incidence has been low regardless of indication or dosage. Most investigators conclude it is a sensitivity reaction. Most cases occur between the second and fourth weeks of therapy. The clinical picture resembles infectious hepatitis with laboratory features of obstructive jaundice rather than those of parenchymal damage. It is usually promptly reversible on withdrawal of the medication> however chronic jaundice has been reported. There is no conclusive evidence that preexisting liver disease makes patients more susceptible to jaundice. Alcoholics with cirrhosis have been successfully treated with chlorpromazine without complications. Nevertheless the medication should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. Patients who have experienced jaundice with a phenothiazine should not if possible be reexposed to chlorpromazine or other phenothiazines. If fever with grippe-like symptoms occurs appropriate liver studies should be conducted. If tests indicate an abnormality stop treatment. Liver function tests in jaundice induced by the drug may mimic extrahepatic obstruction> withhold exploratory laparotomy until extrahepatic obstruction is confirmed. Hematological Disorders including agranulocytosis eosinophilia leukopenia hemolytic anemia aplastic anemia thrombocytopenic purpura and pancytopenia have been reported. Agranulocytosis Warn patients to report the sudden appearance of sore throat or other signs of infection. If white blood cell and differential counts indicate cellular depression stop treatment and start antibiotic and other suitable therapy. Most cases have occurred between the fourth and tenth weeks of therapy> patients should be watched closely during that period. Moderate suppression of white blood cells is not an indication for stopping treatment unless accompanied by the symptoms described above. Cardiovascular Hypotensive Effects Postural hypotension simple tachycardia momentary fainting and dizziness may occur rarely after the first oral dose. Usually recovery is spontaneous and symptoms disappear within xbd to 2 hours. Occasionally these effects may be more severe and prolonged producing a shock-like condition. To control hypotension place patient in head-low position with legs raised. If a vasoconstrictor is required norepinephrine and phenylephrine are the most suitable. Other pressor agents including epinephrine should not be used as they may cause a paradoxical further lowering of blood pressure. EKG Changes particularly nonspecific usually reversible Q and T wave distortions - have been observed in some patients receiving phenothiazine tranquilizers including chlorpromazine. Note: Sudden death apparently due to cardiac arrest has been reported. CNS Reactions Extrapyramidal Symptoms Neuromuscular reactions include dystonias motor restlessness pseudo-parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia and appear to be dose-related. They are discussed in the following paragraphs: Dystonia Class effect Symptoms of dystonia prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat swallowing difficulty difficulty breathing and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Motor Restlessness Symptoms may include agitation or jitteriness and sometimes insomnia. These symptoms often disappear spontaneously. At times these symptoms may be similar to the original neurotic or psychotic symptoms. Dosage should not be increased until these side effects have subsided. If these symptoms become too troublesome they can usually be controlled by a reduction of dosage or change of drug. Treatment with anti-parkinsonian agents benzodiazepines or propranolol may be helpful. Pseudo-parkinsonism Symptoms may include: mask-like facies drooling tremors pillrolling motion cogwheel rigidity and shuffling gait. In most cases these symptoms are readily controlled when an anti-parkinsonism agent is administered concomitantly. Anti-parkinsonism agents should be used only when required. Generally therapy of a few weeks to 2 or 3 months will suffice. After this time patients should be evaluated to determine their need for continued treatment. ( Note : Levodopa has not been found effective in antipsychotic-induced pseudo-parkinsonism.) Occasionally it is necessary to lower the dosage of chlorpromazine or to discontinue the drug. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may appear after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome can also develop although much less frequently after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. This syndrome appears in all age groups. Although its prevalence appears to be highest among elderly patients especially elderly women it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict at the inception of antipsychotic treatment which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear to be irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue face mouth or jaw (e.g. protrusion of tongue puffing of cheeks puckering of mouth chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. In rare instances these involuntary movements of the extremities are the only manifestations of tardive dyskinesia. A variant of tardive dyskinesia tardive dystonia has also been described. There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia> anti-parkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. If clinically feasible it is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment or increase the dosage of the agent or switch to a different antipsychotic agent the syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. Adverse Behavioral Effects Psychotic symptoms and catatonic-like states have been reported rarely. Other CNS Effects Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. (See WARNINGS . ) Cerebral edema has been reported. Convulsive seizures (petit mal and grand mal) have been reported particularly in patients with EEG abnormalities or history of such disorders. Abnormality of the cerebrospinal fluid proteins has also been reported. Allergic Reactions of a mild urticarial type of photosensitivity are seen. Avoid undue exposure to sun. More severe reactions including exfoliative dermatitis and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported occasionally. Contact dermatitis has been reported in nursing personnel> accordingly the use of rubber gloves when administering chlorpromazine liquid or injectable is recommended. In addition asthma laryngeal edema angioneurotic edema and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported. Endocrine Disorders Lactation and moderate breast engorgement may occur in females on large doses. If persistent lower dosage or withdraw drug. False-positive pregnancy tests have been reported but are less likely to occur when a serum test is used. Amenorrhea and gynecomastia have also been reported. Hyperglycemia hypoglycemia and glycosuria have been reported. Autonomic Reactions Occasional dry mouth> nasal congestion> nausea> obstipation> constipation> adynamic ileus> urinary retention priapism> miosis and mydriasis atonic colon ejaculatory disorders/impotence. Special Considerations In Long-Term Therapy Skin pigmentation and ocular changes have occurred in some patients taking substantial doses of chlorpromazine for prolonged periods. Skin Pigmentation Rare instances of skin pigmentation have been observed in hospitalized mental patients primarily females who have received the drug usually for 3 years or more in dosages ranging from 500 mg to 1500 mg daily. The pigmentary changes restricted to exposed areas of the body range from an almost imperceptible darkening of the skin to a slate gray color sometimes with a violet hue. Histological examination reveals a pigment chiefly in the dermis which is probably a melanin-like complex. This pigmentation may fade following discontinuance of the drug. Ocular Changes Ocular changes have occurred more frequently than skin pigmentation and have been observed both in pigmented and nonpigmented patients receiving chlorpromazine usually for 2 years or more in dosages of 300 mg daily and higher. Eye changes are characterized by deposition of fine particulate matter in the lens and cornea. In more advanced cases star-shaped opacities have also been observed in the anterior portion of the lens. The nature of the eye deposits has not yet been determined. A small number of patients with more severe ocular changes have had some visual impairment. In addition to these corneal and lenticular changes epithelial keratopathy and pigmentary retinopathy have been reported. Reports suggest that the eye lesions may regress after withdrawal of the drug. Since the occurrence of eye changes seems to be related to dosage levels and/or duration of therapy it is suggested that long-term patients on moderate to high dosage levels have periodic ocular examinations. Etiology Etiology of both of these reactions is not clear but exposure to light along with dosage/duration of therapy appears to be the most significant factor. If either of these reactions is observed the physician should weigh the benefits of continued therapy against the possible risks and on the merits of the individual case determine whether or not to continue present therapy lower the dosage or withdraw the drug. Other Adverse Reactions Mild fever may occur after large I.M. doses. Hyperpyrexia has been reported. Increases in appetite and weight sometimes occur. Peripheral edema and a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome have been reported. Note: There have been occasional reports of sudden death in patients receiving phenothiazines.

f06ceb05-33ac-4851-be8b-41a864a2cfac,ADVERSE REACTIONS Fluconazole is generally well tolerated. In some patients particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer changes in renal and hematological function test results and hepatic abnormalities have been observed during treatment with fluconazole and comparative agents but the clinical significance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. In Patients Receiving a Single Dose for Vaginal Candidiasis: During comparative clinical studies conducted in the United States 448 patients with vaginal candidiasis were treated with fluconazole 150 mg single dose. The overall incidence of side effects possibly related to fluconazole was 26%. In 422 patients receiving active comparative agents the incidence was 16%. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported in the patients who received 150 mg single dose fluconazole for vaginitis were headache (13%) nausea (7%) and abdominal pain (6%). Other side effects reported with an incidence equal to or greater than 1% included diarrhea (3%) dyspepsia (1%) dizziness (1%) and taste perversion (1%). Most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Rarely angioedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported in marketing experience. In Patients Receiving Multiple Doses for Other Infections: Sixteen percent of over 4000 patients treated with fluconazole in clinical trials of 7 days or more experienced adverse events. Treatment was discontinued in 1.5% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.3% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities. Clinical adverse events were reported more frequently in HIV infected patients (21%) than in non-HIV infected patients (13%)> however the patterns in HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients were similar. The proportions of patients discontinuing therapy due to clinical adverse events were similar in the two groups (1.5%). The following treatment-related clinical adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1% or greater in 4048 patients receiving fluconazole for 7 or more days in clinical trials: nausea 3.7% headache 1.9% skin rash 1.8% vomiting 1.7% abdominal pain 1.7% and diarrhea 1.5%. Hepato-biliary: In combined clinical trials and marketing experience there have been rare cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with fluconazole. (See WARNINGS . ) The spectrum of these hepatic reactions has ranged from mild transient elevations in transaminases to clinical hepatitis cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure including fatalities. Instances of fatal hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly AIDS or malignancy) and often while taking multiple concomitant medications. Transient hepatic reactions including hepatitis and jaundice have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. In each of these cases liver function returned to baseline on discontinuation of fluconazole. In two comparative trials evaluating the efficacy of fluconazole for the suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis a statistically significant increase was observed in median AST (SGOT) levels from a baseline value of 30 IU/L to 41 IU/L in one trial and 34 IU/L to 66 IU/L in the other. The overall rate of serum transaminase elevations of more than 8 times the upper limit of normal was approximately 1% in fluconazole-treated patients in clinical trials. These elevations occurred in patients with severe underlying disease predominantly AIDS or malignancies most of whom were receiving multiple concomitant medications including many known to be hepatotoxic. The incidence of abnormally elevated serum transaminases was greater in patients taking fluconazole concomitantly with one or more of the following medications: rifampin phenytoin isoniazid valproic acid or oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents. Post-Marketing Experience In addition the following adverse events have occurred during post-marketing experience. Immunologic: In rare cases anaphylaxis (including angioedema face edema and pruritus) has been reported. Body as a Whole : Asthenia fatigue fever malaise. Cardiovascular: QT prolongation torsade de pointes. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Central Nervous System: Seizures dizziness. Hematopoietic and Lymphatic: Leukopenia including neutropenia and agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia. Metabolic: Hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia hypokalemia. Gastrointestinal : Cholestasis dry mouth hepatocellular damage dyspepsia vomiting. Other Senses: Taste perversion. Musculoskeletal System: myalgia. Nervous System: Insomnia paresthesia somnolence tremor vertigo. Skin and Appendages : Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis drug eruption including fixed drug eruption increased sweating exfoliative skin disorders including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (see WARNINGS ) alopecia. Adverse Reactions in Children: The pattern and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities recorded during pediatric clinical trials are comparable to those seen in adults. In Phase II/III clinical trials conducted in the United States and in Europe 577 pediatric patients ages 1 day to 17 years were treated with fluconazole at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day for up to 1616 days. Thirteen percent of children experienced treatment-related adverse events. The most commonly reported events were vomiting (5%) abdominal pain (3%) nausea (2%) and diarrhea (2%). Treatment was discontinued in 2.3% of patients due to adverse clinical events and in 1.4% of patients due to laboratory test abnormalities.

42777191-0454-4ccb-8fc3-8b18b0ee43f7,ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious adverse reactions that may be associated with oxycodone and acetaminophen use include respiratory depression apnea respiratory arrest circulatory depression hypotension and shock (see OVERDOSAGE). The most frequently observed non-serious adverse reactions include lightheadedness dizziness drowsiness or sedation nausea and vomiting. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory than in nonambulatory patients and some of these adverse reactions may be alleviated if the patient lies down. Other adverse reactions include euphoria dysphoria constipation and pruritus. Hypersensitivity reactions may include: Skin eruptions urticarial erythematous skin reactions. Hematologic reactions may include: thrombocytopenia neutropenia pancytopenia hemolytic anemia. Rare cases of agranulocytosis has likewise been associated with acetaminophen use. In high doses the most serious adverse effect is a dose-dependent potentially fatal hepatic necrosis. Renal tubular necrosis and hypoglycemic coma also may occur. Other adverse reactions obtained from postmarketing experiences with oxycodone and acetaminophen are listed by organ system and in decreasing order of severity and/or frequency as follows: Body as a Whole: Anaphylactoid reaction allergic reaction malaise asthenia fatigue chest pain fever hypothermia thirst headache increased sweating accidental overdose non-accidental overdose Cardiovascular: Hypotension hypertension tachycardia orthostatic hypotension bradycardia palpitations dysrhythmias Central and Peripheral Nervous System: Stupor tremor paraesthesia hypoaesthesia lethargy seizures anxiety mental impairment agitation cerebral edema confusion dizziness Fluid and Electrolyte: Dehydration hyperkalemia metabolic acidosis respiratory alkalosis Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia taste disturbances abdominal pain abdominal distention sweating increased diarrhea dry mouth flatulence gastrointestinal disorder nausea vomiting pancreatitis intestinal obstruction ileus Hepatic: Transient elevations of hepatic enzymes increase in bilirubin hepatitis hepatic failure jaundice hepatotoxicity hepatic disorder Hearing and Vestibular: Hearing loss tinnitus Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: Acute anaphylaxis angioedema asthma bronchospasm laryngeal edema urticaria anaphylactoid reaction Metabolic and Nutritional: Hypoglycemia hyperglycemia acidosis alkalosis Musculoskeletal: Myalgia rhabdomyolysis Ocular: Miosis visual disturbances red eye Psychiatric: Drug dependence drug abuse insomnia confusion anxiety agitation depressed level of consciousness nervousness hallucination somnolence depression suicide Respiratory System: Bronchospasm dyspnea hyperpnea pulmonary edema tachypnea aspiration hypoventilation laryngeal edema Skin and Appendages: Erythema urticaria rash flushing Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis papillary necrosis proteinuria renal insufficiency and failure urinary retention Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome a potentially life-threatening condition have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.

The following table lists the incidence of all adverse events (whether considered by the investigator drug related or unrelated to drug) from this study which occurred at a rate of 3% or greater in the Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol treatment group and more frequently in the Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol treatment group than in the placebo group. Overall the incidence and nature of the adverse reactions reported for Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol and a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler were comparable. Adverse events reported by less than 3% of the patients receiving Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol and by a greater proportion of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol patients than placebo patients which have the potential to be related to Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol include: dysphonia increased sweating dry mouth chest pain edema rigors ataxia leg cramps hyperkinesia eructation flatulence tinnitus diabetes mellitus anxiety depression somnolence rash. Palpitation and dizziness have also been observed with Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol. Adverse events reported in a 4-week pediatric clinical trial comparing Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol and a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler occurred at a low incidence rate and were similar to those seen in the adult trials. In small cumulative dose studies tremor nervousness and headache appeared to be dose related. Rare cases of urticaria angioedema rash bronchospasm and oropharyngeal edema have been reported after the use of inhaled albuterol.

6a145743-f630-4626-8961-83887d17d0f3,"ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS ). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension somnolence and respiratory failure. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment uses or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies however does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in a Controlled Dose-Comparison Clinical Trial Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg 2 mg and 4 mg. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials In two studies patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients i.e. from all ""patient-episodes."" Table 2 lists the treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. Other Events Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Lorazepam Injection for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus Lorazepam Injection active comparators and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals> infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Preanesthetic Central Nervous System The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another depending on the dosage route of administration use of other central-nervous-system depressants and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness confusion depression crying sobbing and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. Local Effects Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site a sensation of burning or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular System Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. Respiratory System Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance appropriate airway management may become necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Other Adverse Experiences Skin rash nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines paradoxical reactions such as stimulation mania irritability restlessness agitation aggression psychosis hostility rage or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS General ). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome aggravation of pheochromocytoma amnesia apnea/respiratory arrest arrhythmia bradycardia brain edema coagulation disorder coma convulsion gastrointestinal hemorrhage heart arrest/failure heart block liver damage lung edema lung hemorrhage nervousness neuroleptic malignant syndrome paralysis pericardial effusion pneumothorax pulmonary hypertension tachycardia thrombocytopenia urinary incontinence ventricular arrhythmia.

Atenolol 50 mg once daily was used concomitantly in 187 of the 370 patients on nifedipine extendedrelease tablets and in 64 of the 126 patients on placebo. All adverse events reported during nifedipine extendedrelease tablets therapy were tabulated independently of their causal relationship to medication. The most common adverse event reported with nifedipine extendedrelease tablets was peripheral edema. This was dose related and the frequency was 18% on nifedipine extendedrelease tablets 30 mg daily 22% on nifedipine extendedrelease tablets 60 mg daily and 29% on nifedipine extendedrelease tablets 90 mg daily versus 10% on placebo. Other common adverse events reported in the above placebo-controlled trials include: Where the frequency of adverse events with nifedipine extended-release tablets and placebo is similar causal relationship cannot be established.

8c5c762f-d266-4b1a-809e-f11bfc89bc2d,"ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions to ropivacaine are characteristic of those associated with other amide-type local anesthetics. A major cause of adverse reactions to this group of drugs may be associated with excessive plasma levels which may be due to overdosage unintentional intravascular injection or slow metabolic degradation. The reported adverse events are derived from clinical studies conducted in the U.S. and other countries. The reference drug was usually bupivacaine. The studies used a variety of premedications sedatives and surgical procedures of varying length. A total of 3988 patients have been exposed to ropivacaine hydrochloride at concentrations up to 1% in clinical trials. Each patient was counted once for each type of adverse event. Incidence >5% For the indications of epidural administration in surgery cesarean section postoperative pain management peripheral nerve block and local infiltration the following treatment-emergent adverse events were reported with an incidence of >5% in all clinical studies (N=3988): hypotension (37%) nausea (24.8%) vomiting (11.6%) bradycardia (9.3%) fever (9.2%) pain (8%) postoperative complications (7.1%) anemia (6.1%) paresthesia (5.6%) headache (5.1%) pruritus (5.1%) and back pain (5%). Incidence 1 to 5% Urinary retention dizziness rigors hypertension tachycardia anxiety oliguria hypoesthesia chest pain hypokalemia dyspnea cramps and urinary tract infection. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials The reported adverse events are derived from controlled clinical studies with ropivacaine hydrochloride (concentrations ranged from 0.125% to 1% for ropivacaine hydrochloride and 0.25% to 0.75% for bupivacaine) in the U.S. and other countries involving 3094 patients. Table 3A and 3B list adverse events (number and percentage) that occurred in at least 1% of ropivacaine hydrochloride-treated patients in these studies. The majority of patients receiving concentrations higher than 5 mg/mL (0.5%) were treated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. Incidence <>1% The following adverse events were reported during the ropivacaine hydrochloride clinical program in more than one patient (N=3988) occurred at an overall incidence of <>1% and were considered relevant: Application Site Reactions - injection site pain Cardiovascular System - vasovagal reaction syncope postural hypotension non-specific ECG abnormalities Female Reproductive - poor progression of labor uterine atony Gastrointestinal System - fecal incontinence tenesmus neonatal vomiting General and Other Disorders - hypothermia malaise asthenia accident and/or injury Hearing and Vestibular - tinnitus hearing abnormalities Heart Rate and Rhythm - extrasystoles non-specific arrhythmias atrial fibrillation Liver and Biliary System - jaundice Metabolic Disorders - hypomagnesemia Musculoskeletal System - myalgia Myo/Endo/Pericardium - ST segment changes myocardial infarction Nervous System - tremor Horner's syndrome paresis dyskinesia neuropathy vertigo coma convulsion hypokinesia hypotonia ptosis stupor Psychiatric Disorders - agitation confusion somnolence nervousness amnesia hallucination emotional lability insomnia nightmares Respiratory System - bronchospasm coughing Skin Disorders - rash urticaria Urinary System Disorders - urinary incontinence micturition disorder Vascular - deep vein thrombosis phlebitis pulmonary embolism Vision - vision abnormalities For the indication epidural anesthesia for surgery the 15 most common adverse events were compared between different concentrations of ropivacaine hydrochloride and bupivacaine. Table 4 is based on data from trials in the U.S. and other countries where ropivacaine hydrochloride was administered as an epidural anesthetic for surgery. Using data from the same studies the number (%) of patients experiencing hypotension is displayed by patient age drug and concentration in Table 5 . In Table 6 the adverse events for ropivacaine hydrochloride are broken down by gender. Systemic Reactions The most commonly encountered acute adverse experiences that demand immediate countermeasures are related to the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. These adverse experiences are generally dose-related and due to high plasma levels that may result from overdosage rapid absorption from the injection site diminished tolerance or from unintentional intravascular injection of the local anesthetic solution. In addition to systemic dose-related toxicity unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug during the intended performance of lumbar epidural block or nerve blocks near the vertebral column (especially in the head and neck region) may result in underventilation or apnea (""Total or High Spinal""). Also hypotension due to loss of sympathetic tone and respiratory paralysis or underventilation due to cephalad extension of the motor level of anesthesia may occur. This may lead to secondary cardiac arrest if untreated. Factors influencing plasma protein binding such as acidosis systemic diseases that alter protein production or competition with other drugs for protein binding sites may diminish individual tolerance. Epidural administration of ropivacaine hydrochloride has in some cases as with other local anesthetics been associated with transient increases in temperature to >>38.5C. This occurred more frequently at doses of ropivacaine hydrochloride >>16 mg/h. Neurologic Reactions These are characterized by excitation and/or depression. Restlessness anxiety dizziness tinnitus blurred vision or tremors may occur possibly proceeding to convulsions. However excitement may be transient or absent with depression being the first manifestation of an adverse reaction. This may quickly be followed by drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Other central nervous system effects may be nausea vomiting chills and constriction of the pupils. The incidence of convulsions associated with the use of local anesthetics varies with the route of administration and the total dose administered. In a survey of studies of epidural anesthesia overt toxicity progressing to convulsions occurred in approximately 0.1% of local anesthetic administrations. The incidence of adverse neurological reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose and concentration of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques with or without a contribution from the drug. During lumbar epidural block occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter or needle may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered intrathecally as well as the physiological and physical effects of a dural puncture. These observations may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including high or total spinal block) hypotension secondary to spinal block urinary retention loss of bladder and bowel control (fecal and urinary incontinence) and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Signs and symptoms of subarachnoid block typically start within 2 minutes to 3 minutes of injection. Doses of 15 mg and 22.5 mg of ropivacaine hydrochloride resulted in sensory levels as high as T5 and T4 respectively. Analgesia started in the sacral dermatomes in 2 minutes to 3 minutes and extended to the T10 level in 10 minutes to 13 minutes and lasted for approximately 2 hours. Other neurological effects following unintentional subarachnoid administration during epidural anesthesia may include persistent anesthesia paresthesia weakness paralysis of the lower extremities and loss of sphincter control> all of which may have slow incomplete or no recovery. Headache septic meningitis meningismus slowing of labor increased incidence of forceps delivery or cranial nerve palsies due to traction on nerves from loss of cerebrospinal fluid have been reported (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION discussion of Lumbar Epidural Block). A high spinal is characterized by paralysis of the arms loss of consciousness respiratory paralysis and bradycardia. Cardiovascular System Reactions High doses or unintentional intravascular injection may lead to high plasma levels and related depression of the myocardium decreased cardiac output heart block hypotension bradycardia ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation and possibly cardiac arrest (see WARNINGS PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE ). Allergic Reactions Allergic type reactions are rare and may occur as a result of sensitivity to the local anesthetic (see WARNINGS ). These reactions are characterized by signs such as urticaria pruritus erythema angioneurotic edema (including laryngeal edema) tachycardia sneezing nausea vomiting dizziness syncope excessive sweating elevated temperature and possibly anaphylactoid symptomatology (including severe hypotension). Cross-sensitivity among members of the amide-type local anesthetic group has been reported. The usefulness of screening for sensitivity has not been definitively established.","ropivacaine, characteristic, amide-type local anesthetics, group, drugs, excessive, plasma, overdosage,

7adfc439-e6d0-4593-87dd-0eef36d33c6d,ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience with Clonidine Transdermal System Most systemic adverse effects during clonidine transdermal system therapy have been mild and have tended to diminish with continued therapy. In a 3-month multi-clinic trial of clonidine transdermal system in 101 hypertensive patients the systemic adverse reactions were dry mouth (25 patients) and drowsiness (12) fatigue (6) headache (5) lethargy and sedation (3 each) insomnia dizziness impotence/sexual dysfunction dry throat (2 each) and constipation nausea change in taste and nervousness (1 each). In the above mentioned 3-month controlled clinical trial as well as other uncontrolled clinical trials the most frequent adverse reactions were dermatological and are described below. In the 3-month trial 51 of the 101 patients had localized skin reactions such as erythema (26 patients) and/or pruritus particularly after using an adhesive cover throughout the 7-day dosage interval. Allergic contact sensitization to clonidine transdermal system was observed in 5 patients. Other skin reactions were localized vesiculation (7 patients) hyperpigmentation (5) edema (3) excoriation (3) burning (3) papules (1) throbbing (1) blanching (1) and a generalized macular rash (1). In additional clinical experience contact dermatitis resulting in treatment discontinuation was observed in 128 of 673 patients (about 19 in 100) after a mean duration of treatment of 37 weeks. The incidence of contact dermatitis was about 34 in 100 among white women about 18 in 100 in white men about 14 in 100 in black women and approximately 8 in 100 in black men. Analysis of skin reaction data showed that the risk of having to discontinue clonidine transdermal system treatment because of contact dermatitis was greatest between treatment weeks 6 and 26 although sensitivity may develop either earlier or later in treatment. In a large-scale clinical acceptability and safety study by 451 physicians in a total of 3539 patients other allergic reactions were recorded for which a causal relationship to clonidine transdermal system was not established: maculopapular rash (10 cases)> urticaria (2 cases)> and angioedema of the face (2 cases) which also affected the tongue in one of the patients. Marketing Experience with Clonidine Transdermal System The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clonidine transdermal system. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction (2) frequency of reporting or (3) strength of causal connection to clonidine transdermal system. Body as a Whole: Fever> malaise> weakness> pallor> and withdrawal syndrome. Cardiovascular: Congestive heart failure> cerebrovascular accident> electrocardiographic abnormalities (i.e. bradycardia sick sinus syndrome disturbances and arrhythmias)> chest pain> orthostatic symptoms> syncope> increases in blood pressure> sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) block with and without the use of concomitant digitalis> Raynaud's phenomenon> tachycardia> bradycardia> and palpitations. Central and Peripheral Nervous System/Psychiatric: Delirium> mental depression> hallucinations (including visual and auditory)> localized numbness> vivid dreams or nightmares> restlessness> anxiety> agitation> irritability> other behavioral changes> and drowsiness. Dermatological: Angioneurotic edema> localized or generalized rash> hives> urticaria> contact dermatitis> pruritus> alopecia> and localized hypo or hyper pigmentation. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia and vomiting. Genitourinary: Difficult micturition> loss of libido> and decreased sexual activity. Metabolic: Gynecomastia or breast enlargement and weight gain. Musculoskeletal: Muscle or joint pain> and leg cramps. Ophthalmological: Blurred vision> burning of the eyes and dryness of the eyes. Adverse Events Associated with Oral Clonidine Therapy Most adverse effects are mild and tend to diminish with continued therapy. The most frequent (which appear to be dose-related) are dry mouth occurring in about 40 of 100 patients> drowsiness about 33 in 100> dizziness about 16 in 100> constipation and sedation each about 10 in 100. The following less frequent adverse experiences have also been reported in patients receiving clonidine hydrochloride USP tablets but in many cases patients were receiving concomitant medication and a causal relationship has not been established.

3ae1adfa-6c55-4fd8-9d75-049509387ce0,ADVERSE REACTIONS The table below shows the frequencies of the adverse events that occurred in >>5% of the subjects in three placebo-controlled North American studies in which patients in the active treatment arm received 30 mg 60 mg 120 mg or 240 mg of Isosorbide Mononitrate Extended-Release Tablets once daily. In parentheses the same table shows the frequencies with which these adverse events were associated with the discontinuation of treatment. Overall 8% of the patients who received 30 mg 60 mg 120 mg or 240 mg of isosorbide mononitrate in the three placebo-controlled North American studies discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Most of these discontinued because of headache. Dizziness was rarely associated with withdrawal from these studies. Since headache appears to be a dose-related adverse effect and tends to disappear with continued treatment it is recommended that ISMN treatment be initiated at low doses for several days before being increased to desired levels. In addition the three North American trials were pooled with 11 controlled trials conducted in Europe. Among the 14 controlled trials a total of 711 patients were randomized to Isosorbide Mononitrate Extended-Release Tablets. When the pooled data were reviewed headache and dizziness were the only adverse events that were reported by >>5% of patients.

608a0345-fc9c-4170-4f8d-96dbdd7e566a,"ADVERSE REACTIONS Status Epilepticus The most important adverse clinical event caused by the use of Lorazepam Injection is respiratory depression (see WARNINGS ). The adverse clinical events most commonly observed with the use of Lorazepam Injection in clinical trials evaluating its use in status epilepticus were hypotension somnolence and respiratory failure. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials All adverse events were recorded during the trials by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Similar types of events were grouped into standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the table and listings below with the frequencies representing the proportion of individuals exposed to Lorazepam Injection or to comparative therapy. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving different treatment uses or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies however does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in a Controlled Dose-Comparison Clinical Trial Table 1 lists the treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in the patients treated with Lorazepam Injection in a dose-comparison trial of lorazepam 1 mg 2 mg and 4 mg. Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials In two studies patients who completed the course of treatment for status epilepticus were permitted to be reenrolled and to receive treatment for a second status episode given that there was a sufficient interval between the two episodes. Safety was determined from all treatment episodes for all intent-to-treat patients i.e. from all ""patient-episodes."" Table 2 lists the treatment emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 1% of the patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection or diazepam was given. The table represents the pooling of results from the two controlled trials. These trials were not designed or intended to demonstrate the comparative safety of the two treatments. The overall adverse experience profile for lorazepam was similar between women and men. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Generally age greater than 65 years may be associated with a greater incidence of central-nervous-system depression and more respiratory depression. Other Events Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Lorazepam Injection for the Treatment of Status Epilepticus Lorazepam Injection active comparators and Lorazepam Injection in combination with a comparator were administered to 488 individuals during controlled and open-label clinical trials. Because of reenrollments these 488 patients participated in a total of 521 patient-episodes. Lorazepam Injection alone was given in 69% of these patient-episodes (n=360). The safety information below is based on data available from 326 of these patient-episodes in which Lorazepam Injection was given alone. All adverse events that were seen once are listed except those already included in previous listings (Table 1 and Table 2). Study events were classified by body system in descending frequency by using the following definitions: frequent adverse events were those that occurred in at least 1/100 individuals> infrequent study events were those that occurred in 1/100 to 1/1000 individuals. Preanesthetic Central Nervous System The most frequent adverse drug event reported with injectable lorazepam is central-nervous-system depression. The incidence varied from one study to another depending on the dosage route of administration use of other central-nervous-system depressants and the investigator's opinion concerning the degree and duration of desired sedation. Excessive sleepiness and drowsiness were the most common consequences of CNS depression. This interfered with patient cooperation in approximately 6% (25/446) of patients undergoing regional anesthesia causing difficulty in assessing levels of anesthesia. Patients over 50 years of age had a higher incidence of excessive sleepiness or drowsiness when compared with those under 50 (21/106 versus 24/245) when lorazepam was given intravenously (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). On rare occasion (3/1580) the patient was unable to give personal identification in the operating room on arrival and one patient fell when attempting premature ambulation in the postoperative period. Symptoms such as restlessness confusion depression crying sobbing and delirium occurred in about 1.3% (20/1580). One patient injured himself by picking at his incision during the immediate postoperative period. Hallucinations were present in about 1% (14/1580) of patients and were visual and self-limiting. An occasional patient complained of dizziness diplopia and/or blurred vision. Depressed hearing was infrequently reported during the peak-effect period. An occasional patient had a prolonged recovery room stay either because of excessive sleepiness or because of some form of inappropriate behavior. The latter was seen most commonly when scopolamine was given concomitantly as a premedicant. Limited information derived from patients who were discharged the day after receiving injectable lorazepam showed one patient complained of some unsteadiness of gait and a reduced ability to perform complex mental functions. Enhanced sensitivity to alcoholic beverages has been reported more than 24 hours after receiving injectable lorazepam similar to experience with other benzodiazepines. Local Effects Intramuscular injection of lorazepam has resulted in pain at the injection site a sensation of burning or observed redness in the same area in a very variable incidence from one study to another. The overall incidence of pain and burning in patients was about 17% (146/859) in the immediate postinjection period and about 1.4% (12/859) at the 24-hour observation time. Reactions at the injection site (redness) occurred in approximately 2% (17/859) in the immediate postinjection period and were present 24 hours later in about 0.8% (7/859). Intravenous administration of lorazepam resulted in painful responses in 13/771 patients or approximately 1.6% in the immediate postinjection period and 24 hours later 4/771 patients or about 0.5% still complained of pain. Redness did not occur immediately following intravenous injection but was noted in 19/771 patients at the 24-hour observation period. This incidence is similar to that observed with an intravenous infusion before lorazepam is given. Intra-arterial injection may produce arteriospasm resulting in gangrene which may require amputation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Cardiovascular System Hypertension (0.1%) and hypotension (0.1%) have occasionally been observed after patients have received injectable lorazepam. Respiratory System Five patients (5/446) who underwent regional anesthesia were observed to have airway obstruction. This was believed due to excessive sleepiness at the time of the procedure and resulted in temporary hypoventilation. In this instance appropriate airway management may become necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Other Adverse Experiences Skin rash nausea and vomiting have occasionally been noted in patients who have received injectable lorazepam combined with other drugs during anesthesia and surgery. Paradoxical Reactions As with all benzodiazepines paradoxical reactions such as stimulation mania irritability restlessness agitation aggression psychosis hostility rage or hallucinations may occur in rare instances and in an unpredictable fashion. In these instances further use of the drug in these patients should be considered with caution (see PRECAUTIONS General ). Postmarketing Reports Voluntary reports of other adverse events temporally associated with the use of Lorazepam Injection that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the use of Lorazepam Injection include the following: acute brain syndrome aggravation of pheochromocytoma amnesia apnea/respiratory arrest arrhythmia bradycardia brain edema coagulation disorder coma convulsion gastrointestinal hemorrhage heart arrest/failure heart block liver damage lung edema lung hemorrhage nervousness neuroleptic malignant syndrome paralysis pericardial effusion pneumothorax pulmonary hypertension tachycardia thrombocytopenia urinary incontinence ventricular arrhythmia.

The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Gastrointestinal: anorexia nausea vomiting diarrhea glossitis dysphagia enterocolitis inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development. (See WARNINGS .) Rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis Stevens-Johnson syndrome erythema multiforme skin hyperpigmentation maculopapular and erythematous rashes. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon.

a7088b5e-298b-3cc5-e053-2a95a90a5b21,ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects to alprazolam tablets if they occur are generally observed at the beginning of therapy and usually disappear upon continued medication. In the usual patient the most frequent side effects are likely to be an extension of the pharmacological activity of alprazolam eg drowsiness or light-headedness. The data cited in the two tables below are estimates of untoward clinical event incidence among patients who participated under the following clinical conditions: relatively short duration (ie four weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 4 mg/day of alprazolam tablets (for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety) and short-term (up to ten weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 10 mg/day of alprazolam tablets in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. These data cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors often differ from those in clinical trials. These figures cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials are conducted under a different set of conditions. Comparison of the cited figures however can provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the untoward event incidence in the population studied. Even this use must be approached cautiously as a drug may relieve a symptom in one patient but induce it in others. (For example an anxiolytic drug may relieve dry mouth [a symptom of anxiety] in some subjects but induce it [an untoward event] in others.) Additionally for anxiety disorders the cited figures can provide the prescriber with an indication as to the frequency with which physician intervention (eg increased surveillance decreased dosage or discontinuation of drug therapy) may be necessary because of the untoward clinical event. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported in Placebo-Controlled Trials of Anxiety Disorders In addition to the relatively common (ie greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated in the table above the following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines: dystonia irritability concentration difficulties anorexia transient amnesia or memory impairment loss of coordination fatigue seizures sedation slurred speech jaundice musculoskeletal weakness pruritus diplopia dysarthria changes in libido menstrual irregularities incontinence and urinary retention. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported in Placebo-Controlled Trials of Panic Disorder In addition to the relatively common (ie greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated in the table above the following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of Alprazolam Tablets: seizures hallucinations depersonalization taste alterations diplopia elevated bilirubin elevated hepatic enzymes and jaundice. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients (see PRECAUTIONS General ). Adverse Events Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation in Treatment of Panic Disorder in Placebo-Controlled Trials In a larger database comprised of both controlled and uncontrolled studies in which 641 patients received alprazolam tablets discontinuation-emergent symptoms which occurred at a rate of over 5% in patients treated with alprazolam tablets and at a greater rate than the placebo treated group were as follows: From the studies cited it has not been determined whether these symptoms are clearly related to the dose and duration of therapy with alprazolam tablets in patients with panic disorder. There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam tablets (see WARNINGS ). To discontinue treatment in patients taking alprazolam tablets the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of alprazolam tablets be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose> however the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. As with all benzodiazepines paradoxical reactions such as stimulation increased muscle spasticity sleep disturbances hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation rage irritability and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability hostility and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Post Introduction Reports Various adverse drug reactions have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam tablets since market introduction. The majority of these reactions were reported through the medical event voluntary reporting system. Because of the spontaneous nature of the reporting of medical events and the lack of controls a causal relationship to the use of alprazolam tablets cannot be readily determined. Reported events include: gastrointestinal disorder hypomania mania liver enzyme elevations hepatitis hepatic failure Stevens-Johnson syndrome angioedema peripheral edema hyperprolactinemia gynecomastia and galactorrhea (see PRECAUTI,"side effects, alprazolam, therapy, disappear, continued, medication, patient, frequent, side effects, extension, pharmacological activity, alprazolam, drowsiness light-headedness,  tables,  event,  conditions, weeks, placebo-controlled studies, dosages, day, alprazolam, management, anxiety disorders, short-term, relief symptoms, anxiety, short-term, weeks, placebo-controlled studies, dosages, day, alprazolam, panic disorder, agoraphobia,   medical practice, patient, characteristics, trials, figures, studies, drug products, placebo, group  prescriber, contributions,  non-drug factors, event,    symptom, patient, induce, anxiolytic  dry mouth, symptom, anxiety  untoward, event, anxiety disorders, prescriber,  frequency, physician, intervention, surveillance dosage, discontinuation, drug therapy, event, placebo-controlled anxiety disorders, association, benzodiazepines dystonia, irritability, concentration, difficulties, transient, amnesia, memory impairment, loss coordination, fatigue seizures, sedation, slurred speech jaundice, musculoskeletal weakness, diplopia dysarthria, changes, libido, incontinence, urinary retention, placebo-controlled panic disorder, association, alprazolam, seizures, hallucinations, depersonalization taste alterations, diplopia, elevated, bilirubin, elevated, hepatic enzymes jaundice, panic disorder, depressive disorders, reports, suicide, un discontinuation, treatment panic disorder, studies, alprazolam, discontinuation-emergent symptoms, rate,  alprazolam, rate, placebo, treated group, studies, symptoms, dose, duration therapy, alprazolam, panic disorder, reports, withdrawal seizures, decrease, abrupt, discontinuation, alprazolam, discontinue, treatment, alprazolam, dosage, medical practice, daily, dosage, alprazolam, days, dosage, administration, benefit, dosage, reduction, postmarketing discontinuation study, panic disorder, recommended, taper schedule, taper schedule, groups, proportion, schedule, reduction, symptoms, withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepines, paradoxical, stimulation, hallucinations, behavioral, agitation, rage irritability, aggressive, hostile behavior, spontaneous, case reports, behavioral effects, cns drugs, psychiatric conditions, alprazolam, discontinued, isolated, published reports, small numbers, borderline, personality disorder, history, violent, aggressive behavior, alcohol substance abuse, risk events, irritability, hostility, intrusive thoughts, discontinuation, alprazolam, posttraumatic stress disorder, post, drug association, alprazolam, market, introduction, medical event, voluntary reporting system, spontaneous, medical lack controls, relationship, alprazolam, gastrointestinal disorder, hypomania mania, liver enzyme, elevations, hepatitis hepatic failure, stevens-johnson syndrome angioedema, peripheral edema, hyperprolactinemia gynecomastia galactorrhea, precauti"

87228313-cf8d-c861-e053-2991aa0aca5a,ADVERSE REACTIONS Data upon which the following estimates of incidence of adverse reactions are made are derived from experiences reported in the literature unpublished clinical trials and voluntary reports since marketing of allopurinol began. Past experience suggested that the most frequent event following the initiation of allopurinol treatment was an increase in acute attacks of gout (average 6% in early studies). An analysis of current usage suggests that the incidence of acute gouty attacks has diminished to less than 1%. The explanation for this decrease has not been determined but may be due in part to initiating therapy more gradually (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The most frequent adverse reaction to allopurinol is skin rash. Skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal. Therefore treatment with allopurinol should be discontinued immediately if a rash develops (see WARNINGS ). Some patients with the most severe reaction also had fever chills arthralgias cholestatic jaundice eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis or leukopenia. Among 55 patients with gout treated with allopurinol for 3 to 34 months (average greater than 1 year) and followed prospectively Rundles observed that 3% of patients developed a type of drug reaction which was predominantly a pruritic maculopapular skin eruption sometimes scaly or exfoliative. However with current usage skin reactions have been observed less frequently than 1%. The explanation for this decrease is not obvious. The incidence of skin rash may be increased in the presence of renal insufficiency. The frequency of skin rash among patients receiving ampicillin or amoxicillin concurrently with allopurinol has been reported to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS ). Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome or drug hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS) has been reported in association with allopurinol use. The syndrome includes many of the severe reactions described above and is potentially life-threatening and fatal. The syndrome is often characterized by fever severe and profuse skin rash elevated leukocyte counts and in particular elevated eosinophil counts lymphadenopathy and multi-organ pathologies. Systemic symptoms often included but were not limited to the hepatic and renal systems. Symptoms involving the cardiac gastrointestinal lymphatic pulmonary and ophthalmic systems were also reported as occurring as part of the syndrome. It has been reported that symptoms may develop in approximately 1 week from initiating allopurinol therapy but longer latency periods have also been reported.,"     voluntary reports, marketing allopurinol, frequent, event, initiation, allopurinol, treatment, increase, acute attacks gout, analysis, usage,  acute gouty attacks, decrease, therapy, dosage, administration, frequent, reaction, allopurinol, skin rash, skin, fatal, treatment, allopurinol, discontinued, rash, develops, severe, reaction, fever chills arthralgias, cholestatic jaundice, leukocytosis, leukopenia, gout,  allopurinol, months,  rundles, type drug reaction, pruritic maculopapular, skin eruption, scaly exfoliative, usage, skin, decrease,  skin rash, renal insufficiency, frequency, skin rash, ampicillin, amoxicillin, allopurinol, drug rash, eosinophilia, systemic, symptoms, dress syndrome, drug hypersensitivity syndrome, association, allopurinol, syndrome, severe, life-threatening, fatal, syndrome, fever, severe, profuse, skin rash, elevated, leukocyte, elevated, eosinophil, multi-organ pathologies, systemic symptoms, hepatic renal systems, symptoms, cardiac gastrointestinal lymphatic pulmonary ophthalmic systems, part syndrome, symptoms, week, allopurinol therapy, longer, latency"
8748d13d-85df-6ab1-e053-2995a90a2580,ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. The frequency estimates in the following table were derived from controlled studies in hypertensive patients in which adverse reactions were either volunteered by the patient (U.S. studies) or elicited e.g. by checklist (foreign studies). The reported frequency of elicited adverse effects was higher for both atenolol and placebo-treated patients than when these reactions were volunteered. Where frequency of adverse effects of atenolol and placebo is similar causal relationship to atenolol is uncertain. Acute Myocardial Infarction In a series of investigations in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction bradycardia and hypotension occurred more commonly as expected for any beta-blocker in atenolol-treated patients than in control patients. However these usually responded to atropine and/or to withholding further dosage of atenolol. The incidence of heart failure was not increased by atenolol. Inotropic agents were infrequently used. The reported frequency of these and other events occurring during these investigations is given in the following table. In a study of 477 patients the following adverse events were reported during either intravenous and/or oral atenolol administration: In the subsequent International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1) including over 16000 patients of whom 8037 were randomized to receive atenolol treatment the dosage of intravenous and subsequent oral atenolol was either discontinued or reduced for the following reasons: *Full dosage was 10 mg and some patients received less than 10 mg but more than 5 mg. During postmarketing experience with atenolol the following have been reported in temporal relationship to the use of the drug: elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin hallucinations headache impotence Peyronie's disease postural hypotension which may be associated with syncope psoriasiform rash or exacerbation of psoriasis psychoses purpura reversible alopecia thrombocytopenia visual disturbance sick sinus syndrome and dry mouth. Atenolol like other beta-blockers has been associated with the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) lupus syndrome and Raynaud's phenomenon. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS In addition a variety of adverse effects have been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents and may be considered potential adverse effects of atenolol. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis. Allergic: Fever combined with aching and sore throat laryngospasm and respiratory distress. Central Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia> an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place> short-term memory loss> emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium> and decreased performance on neuropsychometrics. Gastrointestinal: Mesenteric arterial thrombosis ischemic colitis. Other: Erythematous rash. Miscellaneous: There have been reports of skin rashes and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. The reported incidence is small and in most cases the symptoms have cleared when treatment was withdrawn. Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the beta-blocker practolol has not been reported with atenolol. Furthermore a number of patients who had previously demonstrated established practolol reactions were transferred to atenolol therapy with subsequent resolution or quiescence of the reaction.

6d0c3e0f-c8e7-f2de-e053-2a91aa0a8b4d,ADVERSE REACTIONS In U.S. and foreign controlled studies the frequency of serious adverse reactions reported was very low. Of 702 patients 11.8% reported adverse reactions and in only 1.5% was glipizide discontinued. Hypoglycemia See PRECAUTIONS and OVERDOSAGE sections. Gastrointestinal Gastrointestinal disturbances are the most common reactions. Gastrointestinal complaints were reported with the following approximate incidence: nausea and diarrhea one in seventy> constipation and gastralgia one in one hundred. They appear to be dose-related and may disappear on division or reduction of dosage. Cholestatic jaundice may occur rarely with sulfonylureas: glipizide should be discontinued if this occurs. Dermatologic Allergic skin reactions including erythema morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions urticaria pruritus and eczema have been reported in about one in seventy patients. These may be transient and may disappear despite continued use of glipizide> if skin reactions persist the drug should be discontinued. Porphyria cutanea tarda and photosensitivity reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. Hematologic Leukopenia agranulocytosis thrombocytopenia hemolytic anemia (see PRECAUTIONS ) aplastic anemia and pancytopenia have been reported with sulfonylureas. Metabolic Hepatic porphyria and disulfiram-like reactions have been reported with sulfonylureas. In the mouse glipizide pretreatment did not cause an accumulation of acetaldehyde after ethanol administration. Clinical experience to date has shown that glipizide has an extremely low incidence of disulfiram-like alcohol reactions. Endocrine Reactions Cases of hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion have been reported with this and other sulfonylureas. Miscellaneous Dizziness drowsiness and headache have each been reported in about one in fifty patients treated with glipizide. They are usually transient and seldom require discontinuance of therapy. Laboratory Tests The pattern of laboratory test abnormalities observed with glipizide was similar to that for other sulfonylureas. Occasional mild to moderate elevations of SGOT LDH alkaline phosphatase BUN and creatinine were noted. One case of jaundice was reported. The relationship of these abnormalities to glipizide is uncertain and they have rarely been associated with clinical symptoms.

d27e25b5-5d02-419f-b098-41fb162c5872,ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine (N = 2133) or placebo (N = 938). The patients were treated with 1 2 4 or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age gender race or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine 2 mg BID in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3 controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does however provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine 2 mg BID reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine were dry mouth headache constipation vertigo/dizziness and abdominal pain. Dry mouth constipation abnormal vision (accommodation abnormalities) urinary retention and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID in the Phase 3 clinical studies occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine 2 mg BID in the 12 week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality. Postmarketing Surveillance The following events have been reported in association with tolterodine use in worldwide postmarketing experience: General : anaphylaxis and angioedema> Cardiovascular : tachycardia palpitations peripheral edema> Central/Peripheral Nervous : confusion disorientation memory impairment hallucinations. Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia (e.g. confusion disorientation delusion) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia.

4e46cac7-00cd-4a01-ba11-9af4960cfbe9,ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse experiences following the administration of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. Adverse experiences may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage or may result from a hypersensitivity idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported. The adverse experiences under Central Nervous System and Cardiovascular System are listed in general in a progression from mild to severe. Central Nervous System: CNS reactions are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by light-headedness nervousness apprehension euphoria confusion dizziness drowsiness tinnitus blurred or double vision vomiting sensations of heat cold or numbness twitching tremors convulsions unconsciousness respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory reactions may be very brief or may not occur at all in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Cardiovascular System: Cardiovascular reactions are usually depressant in nature and are characterized by bradycardia hypotension and cardiovascular collapse which may lead to cardiac arrest. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine are extremely rare and if they occur should be managed by conventional means. Neurologic: There have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration.," administration, lidocaine, amide local anesthetic agents,  plasma, excessive, dosage, hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy, tolerance, patient,  systemic,  central nervous system, cardiovascular system, progression, severe, central nervous system, cns, excitatory, depressant, light-headedness nervousness apprehension, confusion, dizziness drowsiness tinnitus, double vision vomiting, sensations, heat cold numbness, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression arrest, excitatory, manifestation, toxicity, drowsiness, respiratory arrest, cardiovascular system, cardiovascular, depressant, bradycardia, hypotension, cardiovascular, collapse, cardiac arrest, allergic, sensitivity, lidocaine, rare, neurologic, permanent, injury, extraocular muscles, surgical repair, administration"

The most common events (> 1%) associated with discontinuation and considered to be drug related (i.e. those events associated with dropout at a rate approximately twice or greater for paroxetine tablets compared to placebo) included the following: Commonly Observed Adverse Events Major Depressive Disorder The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for paroxetine tablets at least twice that for placebo derived from Table 2) were: Asthenia sweating nausea decreased appetite somnolence dizziness insomnia tremor nervousness ejaculatory disturbance and other male genital disorders. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for paroxetine tablets at least twice that of placebo derived from Table 3) were: Nausea dry mouth decreased appetite constipation dizziness somnolence tremor sweating impotence and abnormal ejaculation. Panic Disorder The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for paroxetine tablets at least twice that for placebo derived from Table 3) were: Asthenia sweating decreased appetite libido decreased tremor abnormal ejaculation female genital disorders and impotence. Social Anxiety Disorder The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for paroxetine tablets at least twice that for placebo derived from Table 3) were: Sweating nausea dry mouth constipation decreased appetite somnolence tremor libido decreased yawn abnormal ejaculation female genital disorders and impotence. Generalized Anxiety Disorder The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for paroxetine tablets at least twice that for placebo derived from Table 4) were: Asthenia infection constipation decreased appetite dry mouth nausea libido decreased somnolence tremor sweating and abnormal ejaculation. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and incidence for paroxetine tablets at least twice that for placebo derived from Table 4) were: Asthenia sweating nausea dry mouth diarrhea decreased appetite somnolence libido decreased abnormal ejaculation female genital disorders and impotence. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables following cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the populations studied. Major Depressive Disorder Table 2 enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more among paroxetine-treated patients who participated in short-term (6-week) placebo-controlled trials in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg to 50 mg/day. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Panic Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder Table 3 enumerates adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more among OCD patients on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 12-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg to 60 mg/day or among patients with panic disorder on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 10- to 12-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 10 mg to 60 mg/day or among patients with social anxiety disorder on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 12-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg to 50 mg/day. Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Table 4 enumerates adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more among GAD patients on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 8-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 10 mg/day to 50 mg/day or among PTSD patients on paroxetine tablets who participated in placebo-controlled trials of 12-weeks duration in which patients were dosed in a range of 20 mg/day to 50 mg/day. Dose Dependency of Adverse Events A comparison of adverse event rates in a fixed-dose study comparing 10 20 30 and 40 mg/day of paroxetine tablets with placebo in the treatment of major depressive disorder revealed a clear dose dependency for some of the more common adverse events associated with use of paroxetine tablets as shown in Table 5: In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 40 and 60 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of OCD there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned. No new adverse events were observed in the group treated with 60 mg of paroxetine tablets compared to any of the other treatment groups. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 10 20 and 40 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of panic disorder there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned except for asthenia dry mouth anxiety libido decreased tremor and abnormal ejaculation. In flexible-dose studies no new adverse events were observed in patients receiving 60 mg of paroxetine tablets compared to any of the other treatment groups. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 40 and 60 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of social anxiety disorder for most of the adverse events there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 and 40 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder for most of the adverse events there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned except for the following adverse events: Asthenia constipation and abnormal ejaculation. In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and 20 and 40 mg of paroxetine tablets in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder for most of the adverse events there was no clear relationship between adverse events and the dose of paroxetine tablets to which patients were assigned except for impotence and abnormal ejaculation. Adaptation to Certain Adverse Events Over a 4 to 6 week period there was evidence of adaptation to some adverse events with continued therapy (e.g. nausea and dizziness) but less to other effects (e.g. dry mouth somnolence and asthenia). Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction With SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain however in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. In placebo-controlled clinical trials involving more than 3200 patients the ranges for the reported incidence of sexual side effects in males and females with major depressive disorder OCD panic disorder social anxiety disorder GAD and PTSD are displayed in Table 6. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with paroxetine treatment. Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome patients recovered without sequelae. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Weight and Vital Sign Changes Significant weight loss may be an undesirable result of treatment with paroxetine tablets for some patients but on average patients in controlled trials had minimal (about 1 pound) weight loss versus smaller changes on placebo and active control. No significant changes in vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure pulse and temperature) were observed in patients treated with paroxetine tablets in controlled clinical trials. ECG Changes In an analysis of ECGs obtained in 682 patients treated with paroxetine tablets and 415 patients treated with placebo in controlled clinical trials no clinically significant changes were seen in the ECGs of either group. Liver Function Tests In placebo-controlled clinical trials patients treated with paroxetine tablets exhibited abnormal values on liver function tests at no greater rate than that seen in placebo-treated patients. In particular the paroxetine tablets versus placebo comparisons for alkaline phosphatase SGOT SGPT and bilirubin revealed no differences in the percentage of patients with marked abnormalities. Hallucinations In pooled clinical trials of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride hallucinations were observed in 22 of 9089 patients receiving drug and 4 of 3187 patients receiving placebo. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Paroxetine Tablets During its premarketing assessment in major depressive disorder multiple doses of paroxetine tablets were administered to 6145 patients in phase 2 and 3 studies. The conditions and duration of exposure to paroxetine tablets varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open and double-blind studies uncontrolled and controlled studies inpatient and outpatient studies and fixed-dose and titration studies. During premarketing clinical trials in OCD panic disorder social anxiety disorder generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder 542 469 522 735 and 676 patients respectively received multiple doses of paroxetine tablets. Untoward events associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of untoward events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tabulations that follow reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The frequencies presented therefore represent the proportion of the 9089 patients exposed to multiple doses of paroxetine tablets who experienced an event of the type cited on at least 1 occasion while receiving paroxetine tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in Tables 2 to 5 those reported in terms so general as to be uninformative and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with paroxetine they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse events are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled trials appear in this listing)> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section.

8b2c581a-f955-4a8e-bf85-e768e903fd10,ADVERSE REACTIONS Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide is usually well tolerated and significant clinical adverse effects have been reported infrequently. The risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium levels greater than 5.5 mEq per liter) with amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide is about 1 to 2 percent in patients without renal impairment or diabetes mellitus (see WARNINGS ). Minor adverse reactions to amiloride hydrochloride have been reported relatively frequently (about 20%) but the relationship of many of the reports to amiloride HCl is uncertain and the overall frequency was similar to hydrochlorothiazide treated groups. Nausea/anorexia abdominal pain flatulence and mild skin rash have been reported and probably are related to amiloride. Other adverse experiences that have been reported with amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide are generally those known to be associated with diuresis thiazide therapy or with the underlying disease being treated. Clinical trials have not demonstrated that combining amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide increases the risk of adverse reactions over those seen with the individual components. The adverse reactions for amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide listed in the following table have been arranged into two groups: (1) incidence greater than one percent> and (2) incidence one percent or less. The incidence for group (1) was determined from clinical studies conducted in the United States (607 patients treated with amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide). The adverse effects listed in group (2) include reports from the same clinical studies and voluntary reports since marketing. The probability of a causal relationship exists between amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide and these adverse reactions some of which have been reported only rarely. 1. Reactions occurring in 3% to 8% of patients treated with amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide. (Those reactions occurring in less than 3% of the patients are unmarked.) 2. See WARNINGS 3. See PRECAUTIONS Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components and within each category are listed in order of decreasing severity: Amiloride Body as a Whole: Painful extremities neck/shoulder ache fatigability. Cardiovascular: Palpitation. Digestive: Activation of probable pre-existing peptic ulcer abnormal liver function jaundice dyspepsia heartburn. Hematologic: Aplastic anemia neutropenia. Integumentary: Alopecia itching dry mouth. Nervous System/Psychiatric: Encephalopathy tremors decreased libido. Respiratory: Shortness of breath cough.

In a study conducted in the Sentinel System increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16000 patients per year and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of > 50000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6700 patients per year.,"amiloride hydrochloride, hydrochlorothiazide, tolerated, effects, risk, hyperkalemia, serum, potassium levels, amiloride hydrochloride, hydrochlorothiazide, renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, amiloride hydrochloride, relationship, reports, amiloride hcl, frequency, hydrochlorothiazide, treated groups, nausea anorexia abdominal pain flatulence, mild skin rash, amiloride,  amiloride hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis, thiazide therapy, disease,  amiloride hydrochlorothiazide, increases, risk, individual, components, amiloride hydrochlorothiazide, groups,   incidence group, studies, states,  amiloride, hydrochlorothiazide, effects, group, reports, studies, voluntary reports, marketing, probability, relationship, amiloride hydrochlorothiazide,  amiloride hydrochloride, hydrochlorothiazide, individual, components, decreasing, severity, amiloride body whole painful, extremities neck shoulder ache fatigability, cardiovascular palpitation, digestive activation, pre-existing, peptic ulcer, abnormal, liver function, jaundice dyspepsia, heartburn, hematologic aplastic anemia, neutropenia, integumentary alopecia, dry mouth, nervous system, psychiatric encephalopathy, tremors libido, respiratory shortness breath cough, intraocular pressure tinnitus, urogenital bladder spasms polyuria, urinary frequency, hydrochlorothiazide, digestive pancreatitis jaundice, intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice sialadenitis, gastric irritation, hematologic aplastic anemia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic necrotizing angiitis, cutaneous vasculitis, respiratory distress, pneumonitis pulmonary edema, photosensitivity fever urticaria purpura, metabolic, imbalance, hyperglycemia glycosuria hyperuricemia, nervous system, psychiatric restlessness, transient, blurred, vision, urogenital interstitial nephritis, postmarketing, non-melanoma, skin cancer, hydrochlorothiazide, associated risk, non-melanoma, skin cancer, study, sentinel system, risk, squamous cell carcinoma, cumulative, doses, risk scc, overall   white taking, cumulative, dose, increase, scc, case, year"

0b25b6b5-d97d-40a8-8926-7e90a97a5ede,ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects to alprazolam tablets if they occur are generally observed at the beginning of therapy and usually disappear upon continued medication. In the usual patient the most frequent side effects are likely to be an extension of the pharmacological activity of alprazolam eg drowsiness or light-headedness. The data cited in the two tables below are estimates of untoward clinical event incidence among patients who participated under the following clinical conditions: relatively short duration (ie four weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 4 mg/day of alprazolam (for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety) and short-term (up to ten weeks) placebo-controlled clinical studies with dosages up to 10 mg/day of alprazolam in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. These data cannot be used to predict precisely the incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors often differ from those in clinical trials. These figures cannot be compared with those obtained from other clinical studies involving related drug products and placebo as each group of drug trials are conducted under a different set of conditions. Comparison of the cited figures however can provide the prescriber with some basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to the untoward event incidence in the population studied. Even this use must be approached cautiously as a drug may relieve a symptom in one patient but induce it in others. (For example an anxiolytic drug may relieve dry mouth [a symptom of anxiety] in some subjects but induce it [an untoward event] in others.) Additionally for anxiety disorders the cited figures can provide the prescriber with an indication as to the frequency with which physician intervention (eg increased surveillance decreased dosage or discontinuation of drug therapy) may be necessary because of the untoward clinical event. In addition to the relatively common (ie greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated in the table above the following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines: dystonia irritability concentration difficulties anorexia transient amnesia or memory impairment loss of coordination fatigue seizures sedation slurred speech jaundice musculoskeletal weakness pruritus diplopia dysarthria changes in libido menstrual irregularities incontinence and urinary retention. In addition to the relatively common (ie greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated in the table above the following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam: seizures hallucinations depersonalization taste alterations diplopia elevated bilirubin elevated hepatic enzymes and jaundice. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients (see PRECAUTIONS General ). Adverse Events Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation in Treatment of Panic Disorder in Placebo-Controlled Trials In a larger database comprised of both controlled and uncontrolled studies in which 641 patients received alprazolam discontinuation-emergent symptoms which occurred at a rate of over 5% in patients treated with alprazolam and at a greater rate than the placebo treated group were as follows: From the studies cited it has not been determined whether these symptoms are clearly related to the dose and duration of therapy with alprazolam in patients with panic disorder. There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam tablets (see WARNINGS ). To discontinue treatment in patients taking alprazolam the dosage should be reduced slowly in keeping with good medical practice. It is suggested that the daily dosage of alprazolam be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every three days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Some patients may benefit from an even slower dosage reduction. In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared this recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose> however the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome. As with all benzodiazepines paradoxical reactions such as stimulation increased muscle spasticity sleep disturbances hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation rage irritability and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability hostility and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Post Introduction Reports: Various adverse drug reactions have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam since market introduction. The majority of these reactions were reported through the medical event voluntary reporting system. Because of the spontaneous nature of the reporting of medical events and the lack of controls a causal relationship to the use of alprazolam cannot be readily determined. Reported events include: gastrointestinal disorder hypomania mania liver enzyme elevations hepatitis hepatic failure Stevens-Johnson syndrome angioedema peripheral edema hyperprolactinemia gynecomastia and galactorrhea (see PRECAUTI,"side effects, alprazolam, therapy, disappear, continued, medication, patient, frequent, side effects, extension, pharmacological activity, alprazolam, drowsiness light-headedness,  tables,  event,  conditions, weeks, placebo-controlled studies, dosages, day, alprazolam, management, anxiety disorders, short-term, relief symptoms, anxiety, short-term, weeks, placebo-controlled studies, dosages, day, alprazolam, panic disorder, agoraphobia,   medical practice, patient, characteristics, trials, figures, studies, drug products, placebo, group  prescriber, contributions,  non-drug factors, event,    symptom, patient, induce, anxiolytic  dry mouth, symptom, anxiety  untoward, event, anxiety disorders, prescriber,  frequency, physician, intervention, surveillance dosage, discontinuation, drug therapy, event, enumerated, association, benzodiazepines dystonia, irritability, concentration, difficulties, transient, amnesia, memory impairment, loss coordination, fatigue seizures, sedation, slurred speech jaundice, musculoskeletal weakness, diplopia dysarthria, changes, libido, incontinence, urinary retention, enumerated, association, alprazolam, seizures, hallucinations, depersonalization taste alterations, diplopia, elevated, bilirubin, elevated, hepatic enzymes jaundice, panic disorder, depressive disorders, reports, suicide, un discontinuation, treatment panic disorder, studies, alprazolam, discontinuation-emergent symptoms, rate,  alprazolam, rate, placebo, treated group, studies, symptoms, dose, duration therapy, alprazolam, panic disorder, reports, withdrawal seizures, decrease, abrupt, discontinuation, alprazolam, discontinue, treatment, alprazolam, dosage, medical practice, daily, dosage, alprazolam, days, dosage, administration, benefit, dosage, reduction, postmarketing discontinuation study, panic disorder, recommended, taper schedule, taper schedule, groups, proportion, schedule, reduction, symptoms, withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepines, paradoxical, stimulation, hallucinations, behavioral, agitation, rage irritability, aggressive, hostile behavior, spontaneous, case reports, behavioral effects, cns drugs, psychiatric conditions, alprazolam, discontinued, isolated, published reports, small numbers, borderline, personality disorder, history, violent, aggressive behavior, alcohol substance abuse, risk events, irritability, hostility, intrusive thoughts, discontinuation, alprazolam, posttraumatic stress disorder, post, drug association, alprazolam, market, introduction, medical event, voluntary reporting system, spontaneous, medical lack controls, relationship, alprazolam, gastrointestinal disorder, hypomania mania, liver enzyme, elevations, hepatitis hepatic failure, stevens-johnson syndrome angioedema, peripheral edema, hyperprolactinemia gynecomastia galactorrhea, precauti"

43785b49-5d1e-4ae9-b2ff-26be910bde7f,ADVERSE REACTIONS The premarketing development program for citalopram included citalopram exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from 3 different groups of studies: 429 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies> 4422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials corresponding to approximately 1370 patient-exposure years. There were in addition over 19000 exposures from mostly open-label European postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with citalopram varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind studies inpatient and outpatient studies fixed-dose and dose-titration studies and short-term and long-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events results of physical examinations vital signs weights laboratory analyses ECGs and results of ophthalmologic examinations. Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events. The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced at least once a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Findings Observed in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Trials Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration 16% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event as compared to 8% of 446 patients receiving placebo. The adverse events associated with discontinuation and considered drug-related (i.e. associated with discontinuation in at least 1% of citalopram-treated patients at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are shown in TABLE 2 . It should be noted that one patient can report more than one reason for discontinuation and be counted more than once in this table. Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among Citalopram-Treated Patients Table 3 enumerates the incidence rounded to the nearest percent of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration. Events included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with citalopram and for which the incidence in patients treated with citalopram was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments uses and investigators. The cited figures however do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied. The only commonly observed adverse event that occurred in citalopram patients with an incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients was ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay) in male patients (see TABLE 3 ). Dose Dependency of Adverse Events The potential relationship between the dose of citalopram administered and the incidence of adverse events was examined in a fixed-dose study in depressed patients receiving placebo or citalopram 10 20 40 and 60 mg. Jonckheere's trend test revealed a positive dose response (p<>0.05) for the following adverse events: fatigue impotence insomnia sweating increased somnolence and yawning. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain however in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. The table below displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking citalopram in a pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with depression. In female depressed patients receiving citalopram the reported incidence of decreased libido and anorgasmia was 1.3% (n=638 females) and 1.1% (n=252 females) respectively. There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with citalopram treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Vital Sign Changes Citalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with citalopram treatment. In addition a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures for citalopram and placebo treatments indicated that citalopram treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes. Weight Changes Patients treated with citalopram in controlled trials experienced a weight loss of about 0.5 kg compared to no change for placebo patients. Laboratory Changes Citalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry hematology and urinalysis variables and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with citalopram treatment. ECG Changes In a thorough QT study citalopram was found to be associated with a dose-dependent increase in the QTc interval (see WARNINGS - QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes). Electrocardiograms from citalopram (N=802) and placebo (N=241) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline (tachycardic or bradycardic outliers respectively). In the citalopram group 1.9% of the patients had a change from baseline in QTcF >>60 msec compared to 1.2% of the patients in the placebo group. None of the patients in the placebo group had a post-dose QTcF >>500 msec compared to 0.5% of the patients in the citalopram group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.5% in the citalopram group and 0.4% in the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.9% in the citalopram group and 0.4% in the placebo group. Other Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Citalopram Following is a list of WHO terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section reported by patients treated with citalopram at multiple doses in a range of 10 to 80 mg/day during any phase of a trial within the premarketing database of 4422 patients. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling those events for which a drug cause was remote those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative and those occurring in only one patient. It is important to emphasize that although the events reported occurred during treatment with citalopram they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients> infrequent adverse events are those occurring in less than 1/100 patients but at least 1/1000 patients> rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.
